FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED Summary: Hara's third application for a work permit as a live-in caregiver was refused. The reasons for refusal were (1) Hara had failed to provide a new employment contract (rather than the one submitted with previous applications) with her prospective employer in Canada and (2) the visa officer was not satisfied that Hara would leave Canada at the end of her stay. The officer noted that Hara had previously overstayed in Canada, had failed to mention her refusals for work permits on previous applications and that Hara had weak connections to Japan, where she was born and raised. Hara applied for judicial review. FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED The Federal Court allowed the application. The officer's decision was set aside and the matter was returned for consideration by a different officer in accordance with this decision.

However, the visa officer's reasons for turning Mr. Dhillon down do not mention or respond to any of the evidence of his ties to India or the likelihood of his timely return there. It must be remembered that Mr. Dhillon was addressing a very specific concern expressed to him by previous visa officers.

A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion, • (a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or • (b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country. Person in need of protection 97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally (a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or (b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if (i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country, (ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country, (iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and (iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care. Person in need of protection (2) A person in Canada who is a member of a class of persons prescribed by the regulations as being in need of protection is also a person in need of protection. Exclusion - Refugee Convention 98. A person referred to in section E or F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. Article 1F(b) of the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees reads as follows: 1F( b ) He has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee;",
