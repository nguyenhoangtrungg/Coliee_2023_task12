In essence, since the jurisprudence has developed clear tests for both, a board cannot depart from them. Therefore, where applicants allege that a board misunderstood the test, the standard is correctness and no deference is owed to the board's understanding of the relevant tests. However, where applicants challenge how the tests were applied to the facts, those are questions of mixed law and fact and the standard is reasonableness ( FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED at paragraphs 20 to 22; FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [2012] FCJ No 1082 ( FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED DLR (4th) 413 [ FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED ]).

[...] Where sufficient state protection is available, claimants will be unable to establish that their fear of persecution is objectively well-founded and therefore will not be entitled to refugee status. It is only where state protection is not available that the court moves to the second stage, wherein it considers whether the conduct alleged to be persecutory can provide an objective basis for the fear of persecution",

      "content": "[28] As for the state protection test, the Board made the following statements in its decision: [6] As states are presumed capable of protecting their citizens, an important issue before me is whether there is clear and convincing evidence that Polish authorities would not, on a balance of probabilities, be reasonably forthcoming with serious efforts to protect the claimants if they were to return to Poland now. It was open to the claimants to rebut the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence that adequate protection would not be reasonably forthcoming to them. ... [8] According to refugee protection law, states only need to provide adequate protection and do not have to provide perfect protection; in other words, states only have to make serious efforts at protection and do not have to provide de facto effective or de facto guaranteed protection. Therefore, the state protection issue here is only whether Polish authorities can be reasonably expected to provide the claimants with serious efforts at protection if they were to return to Poland, and not whether those authorities can be reasonably expected to provide the claimants with de facto effective or de facto guaranteed protection. ... [12] The latest United States of America (US) Department of State country report indicates that the state of Poland does not condone violence or discrimination against ethnic minorities, and it also indicates that Poland is making serious efforts, both in policy and in practice, to combat violence and discrimination against minorities, as follows: ... [15] Response to an Information Request POL103089.E further indicates the same thing: while state protection for ethnic minorities in Poland is not perfect, adequate protection mechanisms do exist and are available to them. ... [17] Based upon my review of the objective country conditions documents referenced above, I find that I am not persuaded on a balance of probabilities that Polish authorities would not be reasonably forthcoming with serious efforts to protect the claimants if they were to return to Poland. I therefore find, on the evidence, that the claimants have not rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence",

      "content": "[29] In FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED I wrote: [26] The Board's decision, however, frequently invokes the \"serious efforts\" of a state to provide protection. This concept is invoked at least ten times in its decision, including in its stating of the test for refugee status: According to refugee protection law, home states only need to provide adequate protection and do not have to provide perfect protection: in other words, home states only need to make serious efforts at protection and do not have to provide de facto effective or de facto guaranteed protection. [27] The use of the phrase \"in other words\" in the passage is incorrect: \"adequate protection\" and \"serious efforts at protection\" are not the same thing. The former is concerned with whether the actual outcome of protection exists in a given country, while the latter merely indicates whether the state has taken steps to provide that protection. [28] It is of little comfort to a person fearing persecution that a state has made an effort to provide protection if that effort has little effect. For that reason, the Board is tasked with evaluating the empirical reality of the adequacy of state protection. [29] This Court has affirmed this interpretation of state protection repeatedly. FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [2010] FCJ No 1589, Mr. Justice Roger Hughes made this clear (at paragraph 8): Another error of law is with respect to what is the nature of state protection that is to be considered. Here the Member found that Mexico \"is making serious and genuine efforts\" to address the problem. That is not the test. What must be considered is the actual effectiveness of the protection",

This is not enough to ground a finding of state protection; regard must be given to what is actually happening and not what the state is endeavoring to put in place ( FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED Imm. L.R.

[30] In the present case, the Board member does make references to \"adequate protection\" and \"serious efforts, both in policy and in practice\". However, in paragraph 17 of the decision, the Board clearly applies the \"serious efforts\" test and in my opinion, paragraph 17 is a central finding in the decision. As well, in paragraph 8 of the decision, the Board also adopts the \"serious efforts\" test. Based on these statements, I am of the view that the board applied the wrong test with respect to its state protection finding.

(1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally (a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or (b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if (i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country, (ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country, (iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and (iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care. 72. (1) Le contrôle judiciaire par la Cour fédérale de toute mesure - décision, ordonnance, question ou affaire - prise dans le cadre de la présente loi est subordonné au dépôt d'une demande d'autorisation. ... 96.
