After they moved in together, Manuel began to physically and sexually abuse the Applicant. He often came home drunk and forbade the Applicant from seeing her family. On 4 May 2005, Manuel threw the Applicant to the floor of their home and kicked her. After this assault, the Applicant went to the police in Cliza",

He said that if Manuel was a abusing her she should be a better wife and stop blaming her husband for her problems. The police officer then went into an office and made a telephone call. The Applicant heard the police officer tell the other party that a woman was making a complaint against Manuel. The police officer returned and told the Applicant that he had spoken with Demetrio Rodriguez - Manuel's uncle and a senior police officer (Demetrio). The police officer told the Applicant that Demetrio said she should go home and stop wasting police time. Demetrio also said that the police were there to solve real crimes, not the complaints of a woman who could not keep her husband happy",

One day, he found the Applicant in a market in there; he grabbed her by the hair, dragged her to the ground, and kicked her. He said she would come back to him whether she liked it or not. Other people who were at the market intervened to stop the violence. Manuel told the Applicant it was not over between them and left",

On this second occasion, the Applicant spoke with a different police officer than she had on her first visit. This police officer gave her a form to complete. After the Applicant completed the form, the police officer stamped her form and gave her a letter with a stamp on it. He also told her that the police would call Manuel, so she gave the police Manuel's contact information. She also gave the police her parents' contact information in Cochabamba, but she did not provide the police with a copy of the report from the doctor she had obtained earlier that day.

The RPD also noted that FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED establishes that, to rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide reliable and probative evidence to satisfy the RPD, on a balance of probabilities, that state protection is inadequate.

It also found that Bolivia faced some human rights problems, including killings by security forces, harsh prison conditions, and a corrupt judiciary. The RPD also found that rape is a serious and underreported problem in Bolivia, even though it is a criminal offence. In addition, the RPD found that spousal rape is not a crime in Bolivia and that violence against women is a pervasive and underreported problem; laws against domestic violence in Bolivia were enforced irregularly and the government took few meaningful steps to combat domestic violence. The RPD noted that, to November 2010, the Family Protection Unit (FPU) had handled 70,792 cases of domestic violence. The FPU is a police authority established to handle cases of assault which are not crimes under the Bolivian Penal Code and has sub-units in many regions of Bolivia",

The Bolivian government had rewritten a law (Law 1674) to address the roles of FPUs, municipal legal services, and non-governmental organizations in combating domestic violence, though this law had not fulfilled expectations. Municipalities in Bolivia are required by law to provide support shelters for women. Although, at the time the Decision was rendered, only thirteen shelters for women existed, the RPD found that more were going to be established within a short time. Victims of domestic violence in Bolivia can record complaints against abusers with the FPU, family courts, and public health centres.

The RPD found that the Applicant was speculating when she said that the police officer had telephoned Demetrio and that her first attempt to get protection against Manuel was not a credible rebuttal of the presumption of state protection because it was a local failure and was based on speculation",

After going to the police a second time, the Applicant fled to La Paz and then left Bolivia. The RPD further noted that, during her second complaint, she had not given the police an address at which she could be contacted in La Paz and had not informed them of her departure from Bolivia.

RIR 2006 also established that not all the regional FPUs recorded domestic violence complaints.

The RPD's conclusion on state protection was unreasonable because it relied on older evidence rather than the most recent evidence available.

(3d) 264 (F.C.T.D.), per Justice Evans (as he then was) at paragraph 16. The RPD is presumed to have considered all the evidence, however, the more important the evidence that is not mentioned specifically and analyzed in the RPD's reasons, the more willing a court may be to infer from the silence that the RPD reached its decision without regard to the evidence: Cepeda- FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED , at para. 17. The applicant has cited a number of recent decisions of this Court where the RPD's determinations on state protection were overturned because the RPD selectively analyzed or failed to deal with compelling evidence of a state's inadequate provision of protection: FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED per Justice O'Keefe at para. 38; FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED per Justice Dawson at para. 15; FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED per Justice Near at para. 17; FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED per Justice Russell at paras. 70-71. In all of the above cases, the RPD failed to explain why it preferred certain documentary evidence over significant and reputable documentary and testimonial evidence which indicated that state protection was inadequate. In this case, the RPD acknowledged at paragraph 14 of the decision that violence against women was a serious problem in Mexico and that enforcement action against male abusers is sorely lacking: para14 Counsel's well-crafted submissions point to a number of failings of the Mexican authorities in dealing with gender violence including a culture of acceptance of the practice even among those who are to enforce the laws against it, a culture of impunity for the abusers and obstacles to protection such as corruption, financial resources available to women, judges discretion in deciding what measures to grant, and practical matters such as orders not being effective until they are served on the abuser. Certainly, documentary evidence indicates that Mexico is having an ongoing battle with violence against women, crime and corruption. While the documentary evidence does support some of what the female claimant fears, it is also mixed with information on current efforts Mexico is taking to combat crime, corruption and violence against women, There is no basis in view of the above excerpt to hold that the RPD ignored contrary evidence.
