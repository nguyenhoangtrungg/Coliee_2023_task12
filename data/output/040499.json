This was the Board's second decision with regard to the Applicant's claim, the first having been quashed by Justice Rennie on March 19, 2012 (2012 FC 313). The determinative issue before the Board was identity and credibility. For the reasons that follow, the application is granted",

The birth certificate was apparently issued by the Democratic Republic of Congo, but bore the stamp of a different country (the Republic of Congo). The letter from the university and the university transcript contained numerous spelling errors. The Board rejected the Applicant's explanation that these errors were a consequence of poor administration during the dictatorship",

The Board found that the inconsistency was of such significance that it could not be explained by the fact, as claimed by the Applicant, that the statement had been written by the immigration officer and that the Applicant could not verify it without his glasses",

      "content": "[20] However, the Board erred in limiting its examination to only a portion of the documents submitted by the Applicant to establish his identity. In particular, the Board failed to deal with the Applicant's original voter card and his driver's license. The Board acknowledged that these documents were filed but did not make any further comments except to mention that the Applicant had provided a false passport. This was clearly not sufficient, not only because the voter card is in effect a national identity card in DRC according to the Country of Origin Information Report from the UK Border Agency (Applicant Record, p. 63), but also because the Canadian Boarder Services Agency gave the benefit of the doubt to the Applicant with respect to the genuineness of these documents. In these circumstances, the Board was required to make a determination of the genuineness of these two documents, and could not simply assume that they are false merely because the passport has been tampered with",

      "content": "[21] In the same vein, I also note that the Board made no mention whatsoever of the Applicant's marriage certificate, of his student card and of another certificate attesting that he lost all his personal identification documents. The Board could not reasonably ignore these documents in assessing the Applicant's identity. Counsel for the Respondent argued that the Board's assessment of the voter card cannot be viewed in isolation. I could not agree more. The same is true, however, of the assessment of the other identity documents on which the Board decided to focus its attention. The Board could not come to a reasonable assessment of the Applicant's identity by only focusing on those documents where authenticity appears doubtful and ignoring those documents which appear to be trustworthy. All the documents filed and the explanations provided by the Applicant must be considered before coming to a conclusion: see FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED , at paras 17-19",

Counsel for the Respondent agreed that the decision cannot stand if the identity finding is not reasonable. A finding that the Applicant is not who he claims to be is prejudicial to his overall claim. Accordingly, there is no need to review the Board's findings with respect to the Applicant's credibility",
