The RAD confirmed the Refugee Protection Division's [RPD] decision dated September 25, 2013 that the Applicant was not a refugee, nor a person in need of protection",

      "content": "[8] The Applicant's refugee application was heard by the RPD on September 23, 2013. It issued its decision and reasons on September 25, 2013. In essence, the RPD did not question the alleged facts following the c oup d'état in March 2012 but noted that general physical violence was present for a short period of time. It did not believe that the Applicant's subsequent allegations were credible. The RPD also concluded that the Applicant had failed to establish that he was a refugee or a person in need of protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA",

      "content": "[13] In its decision, the RAD noted that the admissibility of new evidence was governed by subsection 110(4) of the IRPA. It further mentioned that at the time of rendering its decision, there was no jurisprudence relating to the application of the above-mentioned subsection; therefore, it relied on the Federal Court of Appeal's interpretation of a relevant IRPA provision, that is paragraph 113(a) relating to Pre-Removal Risk Assessment [PRRA] in the case of FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [ Raza ]. The RAD deemed paragraph 113(a) to be similar in its wording and effect as subsection 110(4)",

      "content": "[14] Following the criteria set out FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED , the RAD concluded that the stepfather's letter failed to meet two criteria, namely credibility and materiality. This conclusion was reached by the RAD because the letter was not addressed specifically to the tribunal, nor did it provide an address for the stepfather. Also, the letter had not been notarized and it would not have altered the RPD's decision had it been admitted as evidence prior to the tribunal reaching its decision to reject the Applicant's application",

      "content": "[16] The RAD then proceeded to address the question of standard of review. It noted that the RAD does not perform a judicial review of the RPD's decision. Rather, the matter before the RAD is similar to that of an appeal before a Court. However, given the absence of clear directions in the jurisprudence, the RAD applied the principles set out in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [ Dunsmuir ]. It determined that given that the matter involved questions of credibility, the standard of reasonableness was applicable in the present case",

      "content": "[20] The first approach, which is advocated by the RAD in this case, is the use of judicial review principles using the standard of reasonableness in assessing the RPD's decision. This approach has been rejected by this FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED , which is the \"palpable and overriding error\". Such an approach was used in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [ Alvarez ]",

    {
      "content": "[24] On the other hand, the Respondent argues that the RAD did not err in reviewing the RPD's credibility analysis on the reasonableness standard. In support of this position, the Respondent asks us to consider this Court's decision in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED where Locke J. held that: FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [14] Except in cases where the credibility of a witness is critical or determinative or when the RPD has a particular benefit from the RAD to draw a specific conclusion, the RAD must not give any deference to the analysis of the evidence made by the RPD: see Huruglica , at paras 37 and 55. The RAD has as much expertise as the RPD and maybe more with respect to the analysis of the relevant documents and the representations from the parties. [...] FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [18] The issue of standard of review is not determinative in this case because the RPD's dispositive finding concerns the applicant's credibility. Therefore, even following Huruglica , the RAD was right to defer to the RPD's findings",

      "content": "[27] In Alyafi , Martineau J. makes it clear that by applying the judicial review standard of reasonableness, the RAD committed a reviewable error, see para 46. The RAD does not sit in judicial review of the RPD's decisions. In the present case, the RAD's panel member acknowledged this fact in the contested reasons at paragraph 35, where he stated: FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED Bien que la SAR ne procède pas à un contrôle judiciaire des décisions de la SPR, mais qu'elle agisse plutôt en instance d'appel, au sein du même tribunal administratif qu'est la CISR, j'estime qu'à défaut d'indications plus directes des tribunaux supérieurs, il est possible d'appliquer à la SAR les principes développés dans l'affaire Dunsmuir ",
