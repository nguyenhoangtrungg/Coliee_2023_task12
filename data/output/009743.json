On June 29, 2004, the applicants' claims for protection were rejected by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (Board).

      "content": "[7] In refusing the application, the officer made a number of findings: • The officer noted that the Board had found the applicants to be incredible and their fears not to be well-founded. The officer also noted that the applicants' PRRA had been rejected. After reviewing the documentary evidence, the officer concluded that Mr. Ahmad was not a prominent Shia figure in the eyes of the SSP and therefore not at risk to be targeted. In reaching this decision, the officer gave little weight to statements and affidavits that were submitted to establish that Mr. Ahmad was active in the Shia community and targeted by the SSP. The officer also concluded that Mr. Ahmad's behaviour was not consistent with that of a person under constant threat of attack by the SSP. The officer further concluded that the steps taken by the government of Pakistan had been reasonably effective in addressing the threat of violent attacks. • The officer noted that the applicants had been living in Canada for approximately four years and that they had maintained a \"good civil record\" during that time. The officer also noted that Mr. Ahmad had taken steps to establish a business and was working to support his family. However, the officer did indicate that there was no evidence to indicate that the applicants owned property (or other significant assets) in Canada, which would impede their return to Pakistan, or that Mrs. Nazir had taken steps to secure work or become integrated into the community. The officer also pointed out that the applicants were without family ties in Canada, but did have \"significant\" ties in Pakistan. • The officer noted that the children were early into their academic careers and that each was described as speaking Punjabi. While the officer acknowledged that the children's studies would be disrupted if they returned to Pakistan, the officer was of the view that the change in location and language of instruction would be overcome by the children",

      "content": "[10] Since the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED determining the appropriate standard of review involves two steps. First, the Court must ascertain whether the jurisprudence has already satisfactorily determined the degree of deference to be accorded to the particular type of question at issue. Second, if that initial inquiry proves unsuccessful, the Court must consider the relevant standard of review factors. Those factors include: (i) the presence or absence of a privative clause; (ii) the purpose of the decision-maker in question, as determined by its enabling legislation; (iii) the nature of the question at issue; and (iv) the relative expertise of the decision-maker. See: FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED at paragraphs 57, 62, and 64",

      "content": "[12] As to what review on the reasonableness standard entails, the Supreme Court was express in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED , at paragraph 48, that the collapse of the patent unreasonableness standard of review and the move toward a single standard of reasonableness was not an invitation to more intrusive scrutiny by the Court. At paragraph 49, the majority cautioned that: Deference in the context of the reasonableness standard therefore implies that courts will give due consideration to the determinations of decision makers. As Mullan explains, a policy of deference \"recognizes the reality that, in many instances, those working day to day in the implementation of frequently complex administrative schemes have or will develop a considerable degree of expertise or field sensitivity to the imperatives and nuances of the legislative regime\": D. J. Mullan, \"Establishing the Standard of Review: The Struggle for Complexity.\" (2004), 17 C.J.A.L.P. 59, at p. 93. In short, deference requires respect for the legislative choices to leave some matters in the hands of administrative decision makers, for the processes and determinations that draw on particular expertise and experiences, and for the different roles of the courts and administrative bodies within the Canadian constitutional system",

For example, while the officer quoted one document as stating that sectarian terror attacks continued to decline for the second year in a row, another document stated that the level of sectarian violence remained unchanged. I am not persuaded that any such errors were material to the officer's decision. b. Did the officer err by rejecting corroborative documentary evidence",

      "content": "[23] In my view, the officer committed no reviewable error. She did not ignore the corroborative evidence, but rather gave reasonable reasons for giving little or no weight to the documents. Having read each document, I conclude that the officer could reasonably choose to give the documents little weight because, in each case, the writer either failed to demonstrate any first-hand knowledge of what he recounted or provided information lacking in detail. No document provided sufficient information about Mr. Ahmad's activities to plausibly or credibly explain why he was targeted by the FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED selectively relied on other evidence relating to sectarian violence in Pakistan. The applicants further argue that the officer focused on a beating Mr. Ahmad received in 1984 and then relied on the passage of time to conclude that he was no longer of interest to the SSP. This is said to ignore the basis of Mr. Ahmad's claim. Mr. Ahmad says that he was not targeted because of the initial attack; he was attacked because of his continued participation in the Shia community",

That said terrorists can strike anywhere.

The officer wrote: The male applicant's first run in with the SSP was in 1984. He would have been sixteen (16) years old at the time. Age alone would not preclude him from being prominent, but I find there is insufficient objective evidence to establish he projected a profile that would attract the SSP. I am not persuaded that he was in a position to provide financially and religiously to the community to a degree that he personally attracted the attention of the SSP.

As set out in their memorandum of argument, the applicants argue that: [The officer's] focus was on the children's ability to speak in their parents' mother tongue and how advanced there were in their education. The only 'risk' factors she considered in relation to the children was child trafficking and sexual exploitation. There were other obvious factors which the officer ought to have considered, given her statutory obligation to consider the children's best interests. One significant factor is the ongoing religious violence in Pakistan against minority religious groups, including the Shia. These children have lived in Canada for close to five years. They have grown up in a tolerant community, where religious violence is rare. This officer failed entirely to consider the impact on them of having to return to a country which is rife with religious violence and in which they are a minority",

However, this duty only arises when it is sufficiently clear from the material submitted to the decision maker that an application relies on this factor, at least in part.
