      "content": "[1] Rennie, J. : The applicant seeks an order setting aside the May 24, 2011 decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration Refugee Board of Canada (the Board), which found her to be neither a Convention (United Nations' Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees , [1969] Can TS No 6) refugee nor a person in need of protection under sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act , 2001, SC 2001, c. 27 ( IRPA ). For the reasons that follow, the application for judicial review is granted",

      "content": "[2] The applicant is from St. Lucia and fears her ex-boyfriend. The Board refused the applicant's claim on the basis that she lacked credibility. The Board found: The claimant's testimony was marked with inconsistencies, contradictions and implausibilities. The claimant's evidence concerning the more material aspects of her claim was neither consistent nor cogent. Given the importance of the search for her parents to her story, it is reasonable to expect the claimant to give clear and consistent evidence in this regard",

      "content": "[3] I find that the Board's decision falls outside the scope or range of legally permissible outcomes given the facts and law and is unreasonable. Notwithstanding the concerns about the applicant's credibility, the decision fails to substantively analyze the claim. Instead of focusing on the factual issues that are material to a claim for protection, the Board focused its attention on matters that were immaterial and irrelevant to the claim for protection. In consequence, the Board undertook no analysis of the principle basis of the claim of risk. As Justice Luc Martineau held in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED paras 10-12: ....the Board is entitled to make reasonable findings based on implausibilities, common sense and rationality ...The Board may reject uncontradicted evidence if it is not consistent with the probabilities affecting the case as a whole, or where inconsistencies are found in the evidence .... However, not every kind of inconsistency or implausibility in the applicant's evidence will reasonably support the Board's negative findings on overall credibility. It would not be proper for the Board to base its findings on extensive \"microscopic\" examination of issues irrelevant or peripheral to the applicant's claim: .... In particular, where a claimant travels on false documents, destroys travel documents or lies about them upon arrival following an agent's instructions, it has been held to be peripheral and of very limited value to a determination of general credibility",

      "content": "[4] Secondly, the Board's determination that the applicant lacked credibility was vague and imprecise. Prior to examining the decision in question, it is helpful to revisit some of the principles which govern the assessment of credibility: a. A board is entitled to make findings of credibility based on implausibility, common sense and rationality: FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED ; FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED , above; b. Uncontradicted evidence may be rejected if it is not consistent with the probabilities of the case as a whole, or where inconsistencies are found in the evidence: FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED ; c. Inferences must be reasonable and must be set out in clear and unmistakable terms: FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED ; d. Not all inconsistencies and implausibilities will support a negative finding of credibility. Adverse credibility findings should not be based on microscopic examination of issues irrelevant or peripheral to the claim: FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED ; e. Evidence or testimony with respect to whether a claimant travels on false travel documents, destroys travel documents or lies about them upon arrival is peripheral and of very limited value to a determination of credibility: FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED ; f. Assessment of testimony should take into account the age, culture, background and prior social experience of the witness, as should a lack of coherence in testimony where the psychological condition of the witness has been medically established; g. Similarly, in assessing statements made by refugees to immigration officials on first arrival to Canada, the trier of fact must consider that \"most refugees have lived experiences in their country of origin which gives them good reason to distrust persons in authority\": Professor J.C. Hathaway, The Law of Refugee Status (Toronto, Butterworths) (1991), pp 84-85, as cited by Justice Martineau in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED ; h. Where a credibility finding is based on inconsistencies of the applicant, specific examples of inconsistency must be set out. The inconsistency must arise in respect of other evidence which was accepted as trustworthy. Put otherwise, an inconsistency can arise in one of two ways: evidence is internally inconsistent in the testimony of the witness, or; evidence that is inconsistent with respect to the testimony of other witnesses or documents. If, in the later situation, that of external inconsistency, the evidence on which the inconsistency is predicated must be accepted as trustworthy; i. The cumulative effect of minor inconsistencies and contradictions can support an overall finding that an applicant is not credible: FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED ",

      "content": "[5] In the present case, the Board placed an unreasonable emphasis on the applicant's travel documents which, in turn, served as the basis for rejecting the claim. As for the inconsistencies , contradictions and implausibilities which the Board claimed marked the entirety of the applicant's testimony, the Board failed to provide specific examples or to demonstrate new the applicant's testimony was inconsistent, contradictory or implausible. In Hilo, the Federal Court of Appeal held at paragraph 6 that: ...the board was under a duty to give its reasons for casting doubt upon the appellant's credibility in clear and unmistakable terms. The board's credibility assessment ....is defective because it is couched in vague and general terms. The board concluded that the appellant's evidence lacked detail and was sometimes inconsistent. Surely particulars of the lack of detail and of the inconsistencies should have been provided. Likewise particulars of his inability to answer questions should have been made available",

To the extent reasons were given, they were vague and speculative.

In this regard, two observations are in order. First, the Board was focussed on its analysis on events prior to those giving rise to the claim, such that it never asked the question; secondly, the name of the persecutor was included in the applicant's PIF",

The Board member was clearly of the view that the applicant held status in another country and theorized as to how the applicant's life unfolded: ... I believe it more plausible that Liz left Saint Lucia with her parents and the middle child Lena, leaving the eldest child alone in Saint Lucia, rather than the story Liz wants the Division to accept, ",

It is a temporary resident visitor. So, if I were to ask you for your permission to give me your consent ... CLAIMANT: Yeah you can (inaudible).
