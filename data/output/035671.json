      "content": "[23] In FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED , at paragraphs 27-28, Carolyn Layden-Stevenson J. referred to the principles applicable to matters of complicity: Accomplices as well as principal actors may be found to have committed international crimes (although, for present purposes, I am not concerned with principal actors). The court accepted the notion of complicity defined as a personal and knowing participation FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED and complicity through association whereby individuals may be rendered responsible for the acts of others because of their close association with the principal actors FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED . Complicity rests on the existence of a shared common purpose and the knowledge that all of the parties may have of it: Ramirez; Moreno. Madam Justice Reed in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED (T.D.) synthesized the trilogy principles at pages 84 and 85: The Ramirez, Moreno, and Sivakumar cases all deal with the degree or type of participation which will constitute complicity. Those cases have established that mere membership in an organization which from time to time commits international offences is not normally sufficient to bring one into the category of an accomplice. At the same time, if the organization is principally directed to a limited, brutal purpose, such as a secret police activity, mere membership may indeed meet the requirements of personal and knowing participation. The cases also establish that mere presence at the scene of an offence, for example, as a bystander with no intrinsic connection with the persecuting group will not amount to personal involvement. Physical presence together with other factors may however qualify as a personal and knowing participation. As I understand the jurisprudence, it is that a person who is a member of the persecuting group and who has knowledge that activities are being committed by the group and who neither takes steps to prevent them from occurring (if he has the power to do so) nor disengages himself from the group at the earliest opportunity (consistent with safety for himself) but who lends his active support to the group will be considered to be an accomplice. A shared common purpose will be considered to exist. I note that the situation envisaged by this jurisprudence is not one in which isolated incidents of international offences have occurred but where the Board of such offences is a continuous and regular part of the operation",

It is not working within an organization that makes someone an accomplice to the organization's activities, but knowingly contributing to those activities in any way or making them possible, whether from within or from outside the organization. At p. 318, MacGuigan J.A. said that \"[a] t bottom, complicity rests . . . on the existence of a shared common purpose and the knowledge that all of the parties in question may have of it\".
