The PRRA Officer found that the evidence as a whole fell short to establish, on the balance of probabilities, that the Applicant would be personally in danger in his home country. With regards to the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death of the Applicant's father, according to which the primary cause of death was \"severe shock\" and the secondary cause was \"food poisoning\", the Officer relied on a publicly available website pertaining to health and medicine and remarked that food poisoning can result from chemical products as well as viruses, bacteria and parasites. The Officer also noted that the certificate did not specify that the death was caused by a criminal act. The Officer also awarded a low probative value to the Applicant's mother's Medical Certificate of Cause of Death because it was insufficient to support the Applicant's claim that his life would be at risk if he were to return to Nigeria. As for the Certificates of Occupancy, the Officer noted that they merely show that the Applicant's father had two properties in 2005 and 2000.

The determination of risk on return to a particular country is in large part a fact-driven inquiry. The same is true of the assessment called for by an H&C application, as the Officer is required to examine the particular situation of an applicant in order to determine if it would create a situation of unusual and undeserved, or disproportionate hardship if he or she was required to apply for permanent residence in this country from outside Canada. Indeed, the reasonableness standard has consistently been applied in reviewing PRRA and H&C decisions (see, for example, FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED ). Accordingly, a significant degree of deference is owed to these decisions. As the Supreme Court of Canada stated in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [ FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED ] \"reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process. But it is also concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\"",

In some cases, the Court applied a correctness standard because the matter was viewed essentially as a matter of procedural fairness (see, for example, FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED (available on FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED (available on CanLII)). On the other hand, the reasonableness was applied in other cases on the basis that the appropriateness of holding a hearing in light of a particular context of a file calls for discretion and commands deference (see, for example, FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED (available on FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED FTR 160 [ FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED ]; FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED (available on CanLII) [ FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED ] ).

In the case at bar, I have no doubt that the Applicant's stepmother's willingness to kill for the inheritance is a serious and central element of the PRRA application that would substantiate the Applicant's fear of returning to Nigeria and that, if accepted, that evidence would have justified allowing the application for protection, pursuant to paragraphs 167(b) and (c) of the Regulations ",

These notions are quite different, and it is trite law that the Court must look beyond the words of a decision in order to determine whether it is based on the sufficiency of the evidence or if it amounts to a credibility determination. As recently noted in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED (available on CanLII), not every finding of insufficiency of evidence can be found to be a credibility finding by a PRRA officer. There is a difference, albeit sometimes tenuous, between simply not believing an applicant and an applicant not having met his burden of proof on a balance of probabilities",

      "content": "[32] FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED ACWS (3d) 397 [ Ferguson ], Justice Zinn held that a trier of fact may consider the probative value of the evidence without considering its credibility. In other words, there is a difference between saying that an applicant has not met his burden of proof than to conclude that his allegations are not credible. This is because applicants do have a burden to meet, and the evidence they adduce may or may not satisfy the legal threshold prescribed by law, without regard to credibility: It is open to the trier of fact, in considering the evidence, to move immediately to an assessment of weight or probative value without considering whether it is credible. Invariably this occurs when the trier of fact is of the view that the answer to the first question [whether the evidence is credible] is irrelevant because the evidence is to be given little or no weight, even if it is found to be reliable evidence. For example, evidence of third parties who have no means of independently verifying the facts to which they testify is likely to be ascribed little weight, whether it is credible or not.

A careful reading of her reasons reveals that she made findings as to the probative value and sufficiency of the elements of evidence. She gave little probative value to the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death of the Applicant's father, because food poisoning, which is listed as the secondary cause of death, can result from chemical products as well as viruses, bacteria and parasites. As such, this mention is insufficient to establish that the Applicant's father was poisoned by his stepmother. Similarly, the Officer found that the production of the Applicant's mother's Medical Certificate of Cause of Death alone, is similarly insufficient to support the Applicant's claim that his life would be at risk if he were to return to Nigeria. Finally, she also gave low probative value to both the two Certificates of Occupancy, as they merely establish that the Applicant's father owned these two properties, and to the handwritten letter of one Olufemi Oketadi, as the relationship between the Applicant and this person has not been established",

First of all, it seems to me that characterizing the definition of \"food poisoning\" found in a dictionary as extrinsic evidence is a little bit of a stretch. It has nothing to do with the kind of information the use of which was found to be detrimental to an applicant in cases such as FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED (available on QL) (FCA) and FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED (available on CanLII) (FCA). In those cases, what was at stake was information obtained from an outside party and internal Ministry reports relied upon in making discretionary decisions.

The Applicant knew or should have known the meaning of the term \"food poisoning\" mentioned in the Medical Certificate he used to support his allegation that his father had been poisoned by his stepmother. The information was publicly available, and it should have been obvious to the Applicant that a diligent officer would inquire into the proper meaning of the terms used by a medical practitioner to describe the causes of death in the Medical Certificate, that he chose to submit as documentary evidence. Indeed, the information relied upon by the Officer in her quest to interpret \"food poisoning\" can be considered common knowledge, and it is far from obvious what the Applicant could have said in an interview to dispute and counter what she found on a medical health website. Disclosure requirements aim at giving the opportunity to correct prejudicial misunderstandings, misstatements, errors or omissions.

I acknowledge that this conclusion appears to contradict the finding of my colleague Justice Harrington, who granted the Applicant's stay motion on the basis that he should have been interviewed since his credibility was impeached. However, it is trite law that the threshold of a \"serious issue\"for the purpose of a stay motion is lower than the standard of an \"arguable case\" in the context of an application for leave and for judicial review, and significantly lower than what must be made out on a judicial review (see, for example, FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED ACWS (3d) 358; FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED ACWS (3d) 778; FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED ACWS (3d) 299; FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED ACWS (3d) 596).

She found in favour of the Applicant that his two year old son would benefit from his father's presence and that the Applicant provided financially for his family. Nevertheless, in weighing the entirety of the evidence on this matter, the Officer discussed the impact of the Applicant's removal on the financial well-being of the family and observed that the Applicant had not provided information on possible alternatives; by way of example, that he could provide for them from Nigeria or that the father of his spouse's children could support them",

At the time of the decision, two of these children were adults, while the two others were in their late teenage years. It is clear that in comparison to the Applicant's two year old son, these children are much more autonomous and the removal of the Applicant will have less of an impact on them, both financially and emotionally",

While it is understandable for the Applicant to be dissatisfied with the weight given to the elements he provided, it cannot be said that the Officer ignored the best interests of the children. I find that she did not commit any reviewable error in this respect. d) Did the Officer err in her assessment of the various factors submitted by the Applicant in support of his application",

Indeed, the existence of a humanitarian or compassionate review offers an individual special and additional consideration to be exempted from Canadian immigration laws that are otherwise universally applied. The decision not to grant an exemption under ss. 25(1) of the IRPA takes no right away from an applicant, who may still apply for status from outside Canada, which is the usual requirement under Canadian immigration legislation",
