    {
      "content": "[1] Near, J. : This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board), dated July 14, 2011. The Board found that the Applicants were neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection within the meaning of sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act , SC 2001, c 27 (IRPA)",

      "content": "[2] The Principal Applicant (Beata Kis) and her children (Laura Bardi, Jozsef Bardi and Cintia Bardi) are Hungarian citizens. They made refugee claims in Canada on April 27, 2010 fearing persecution for their Roma ethnicity",

    {
      "content": "[3] The Principal Applicant referred to her previous experiences as well as those of her children being teased and called derogatory names at school. While living with the father of her children from 1994 to 2003, the Principal Applicant stated that police would stop and harass them",
      "year": 2012

    {
      "content": "[4] Among other incidents, the Principal Applicant described a fight with a vendor over some candy. The vendor assaulted her and called the police, who ultimately accused her of committing the assault. Following the incident, the Principal Applicant attended court but received a warning that this should not happen again rather than a conviction",

      "content": "[5] The Principal Applicant also tried to obtain child support from the father of her children after he left her in 2003. Members of his family threatened her, called children's protection services and attacked her in 2008",

    },
    {
      "content": "[6] The Board accepted that the Principal Applicant and her children had faced some difficulty in the past and been harassed because of their Roma ethnicity. Considering attempts by Hungary to correct historical discrimination as outlined in documentary evidence, however, the Board found the Applicants had failed to rebut the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence. The Board summarized its conclusion as follows: FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED It is accepted that Hungary has had difficulties in the past with addressing racism and discrimination against Roma. However I accept the documentary evidence outlined above. This suggests that although not perfect, there is adequate state protection FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED and that Hungary is making serious and genuine efforts to erase the problem of racism against Roma",

      "content": "[8] The appropriate standard of review in this instance is reasonableness (see FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [2008] FCJ No 771 at paras 11-13).

      "content": "[11] I must stress that the Board is presumed to have considered all of the evidence before it, unless the contrary is shown ( FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED (CA)). There is no requirement to mention each and every piece of documentary evidence ( FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED (CA))",

      "content": "[12] The Board weighed the documentary evidence related to state protection recognizing the history of discrimination against Roma FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED but balancing this against steps taken to address these issues, such as limiting activities of certain groups and training to change attitudes of police towards minorities. The failure to refer to two specific reports does not make the conclusion reached unreasonable in the circumstances",

      "content": "[19] While the Board did not conduct a formal analysis of subjective fear in this instance, it still gave relatively detailed consideration to the Applicant's circumstances before proceeding to address state protection. This assessment proved sufficient to dispose of the claim. The Applicants' disagreement with the weight given to their personal circumstances in this context does not provide a basis for the strict application of FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED or constitute a reviewable error",
