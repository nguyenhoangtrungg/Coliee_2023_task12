This application arises out of an administrative decision refusing to defer the removal of the Applicants from Canada made in July of 2006. That decision was stayed by Order of this Court on August 2, 2006. By the time this application came before the Court, the serious issues identified in the stay decision were, in practical terms, academic. This case is on all fours with the decision of Justice Frederick Gibson in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED 2007 FC 377 where a similar application was dismissed on the ground of mootness. I would resolve this application on the same basis",
