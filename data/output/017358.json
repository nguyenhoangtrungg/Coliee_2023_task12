Number of points (2) The Minister shall fix and make available to the public the minimum number of points required of a skilled worker, on the basis of (a) the number of applications by skilled workers as members of the federal skilled worker class currently being processed; (b) the number of skilled workers projected to become permanent residents according to the report to Parliament referred to in section 94 of the Act; and (c) the potential, taking into account economic and other relevant factors, for the establishment of skilled workers in Canada.

The provision makes no mention of a final decision. Rather, it states that it must have been \"established\" by an officer prior to 29 March 2012 that the Applicant met the selection criteria.

This is indicated by the notation \"IMM1017S REQUESTED: 23-11-2010\", and suggests that a positive selection decision had been made. The Applicant says that the Respondent's submissions on this point are contradictory: the Respondent acknowledges at one point that medical checks may have been triggered, but argues elsewhere that the fact that medical checks were not initiated is evidence that the review of the Applicant's application did not result in a favourable selection decision",

There is an October 20 2010 entry in the CAIPS made by \"VCH\". The initials VCH refer to Victoria Chua. Ms. Chua is locally engaged staff employed at the Canadian Embassy in Beijing. Although I was not responsible for the assessment of economic applications in October 2010, I understand that, at that time, Program Assistants in Beijing would review FSW applications and enter points against selection criteria in preparation for review by an officer. This was an administrative task - taking information on file at face value and putting the information against the assessment criteria. The file was then reviewed by an officer for selection; only after an officer had reviewed the file would a selection decision be entered, and next processing actions initiated. Program Assistants do not have the delegated authority to make selection decisions. 4. Based on my knowledge of the locally engaged staff, I can confirm that Victoria Chua was employed in the Immigration Section as a Program Assistant in the Immigration Registry at the time I arrived in Beijing. She joined the Economic Class Unit as a Program Assistant in September, 2010. Although she was not under my supervision as a member of the Economic Class Unit, I was aware of the work performed by Program Assistants in that unit. Ms. Chua continued to work in the Economic Class Unit until April, 2011.
