On this point, the officer stated: [TRANSLATION] The applicant has not filed any document suggesting that a charge was brought against him under the Romanian criminal code for sedition. I do not have an indictment, police report or arrest warrant. I note that the applicant has been in Canada for more than 13 years and that in that time he has not managed to get the documents confirming the charges pending against him. . . . I note that the facts raised in the refugee claim, dating from 1992, do not mention any such charge. The only one that he mentions in the PIF is the one for driving while intoxicated . . . the applicant has not established, through trustworthy and objective evidence, that a charge under the Romanian criminal code is pending against him . Since the fears of the judicial process as well as the risk of detention are based on the existence of this charge and considering that this fact was not proven, I am not persuaded that the applicant met his burden of establishing that there would be a personalized risk if he were to return to Romania",

[. . . . .] 97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally (a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or (b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if (i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country, (ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country, (iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and (iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care. [. . . . .] 113. Consideration of an application for protection shall be as follows: (a) an applicant whose claim to refugee protection has been rejected may present only new evidence that arose after the rejection or was not reasonably available, or that the applicant could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection; (b) a hearing may be held if the Minister, on the basis of prescribed factors, is of the opinion that a hearing is required; (c) in the case of an applicant not described in subsection 112(3), consideration shall be on the basis of sections 96 to 98; (d) in the case of an applicant described in subsection 112(3), consideration shall be on the basis of the factors set out in section 97 and (i) in the case of an applicant for protection who is inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality, whether they are a danger to the public in Canada, or (ii) in the case of any other applicant, whether the application should be refused because of the nature and severity of acts committed by the applicant or because of the danger that the applicant constitutes to the security of Canada. Loi sur l’immigration et la protection des réfugiés, L.C. 2001, ch. 27 96. A qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention -- le réfugié -- la personne qui, craignant avec raison d’être persécutée du fait de sa race, de sa religion, de sa nationalité, de son appartenance à un groupe social ou de ses opinions politiques: a) soit se trouve hors de tout pays dont elle a la nationalité et ne peut ou, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de chacun de ces pays; b) soit, si elle n’a pas de nationalité et se trouve hors du pays dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, ne peut ni, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut y retourner.

Il est disposé de la demande comme il suit: a) le demandeur d’asile débouté ne peut présenter que des éléments de preuve survenus depuis le rejet ou qui n’étaient alors pas normalement accessibles ou, s’ils l’étaient, qu’il n’était pas raisonnable, dans les circonstances, de s’attendre à ce qu’il les ait présentés au moment du rejet; b) une audience peut être tenue si le ministre l’estime requis compte tenu des facteurs réglementaires; c) s’agissant du demandeur non visé au paragraphe 112(3), sur la base des articles 96 à 98; d) s’agissant du demandeur visé au paragraphe 112(3), sur la base des éléments mentionnés à l’article 97 et, d’autre part: (i) soit du fait que le demandeur interdit de territoire pour grande criminalité constitue un danger pour le public au Canada, (ii) soit, dans le cas de tout autre demandeur, du fait que la demande devrait être rejetée en raison de la nature et de la gravité de ses actes passés ou du danger qu’il constitue pour la sécurité du Canada.

A person whose application for protection was rejected and who has remained in Canada since being given notification under section 160 may make another application. Written submissions, if any, must accompany the application. For greater certainty, the application does not result in a stay of the removal order. . . . . . 167.

Règlement sur l’immigration et la protection des réfugiés (DORS/2002-227) 165. La personne dont la demande de protection a été rejetée et qui est demeurée au Canada après la délivrance de l’avis visé à l’article 160 peut présenter une autre demande de protection. Les observations écrites, le cas échéant, doivent accompagner la demande. Il est entendu que la demande n’opère pas sursis de la mesure de renvoi. [. . . . .] 167. Pour l’application de l’alinéa 113(b) de la Loi, les facteurs ci-après servent à décider si la tenue d’une audience est requise: a) l’existence d’éléments de preuve relatifs aux éléments mentionnés aux articles 96 et 97 de la Loi qui soulèvent une question importante en ce qui concerne la crédibilité du demandeur; b) l’importance de ces éléments de preuve pour la prise de la décision relative à la demande de protection; c) la question de savoir si ces éléments de preuve, à supposer qu’ils soient admis, justifieraient que soit accordée la protection",
