She notes that she voluntarily executed the removal order which was in place against her",

    {
      "content": "[17] The Applicant argues that the Officer found she was not a genuine worker without any evidence for this finding. She relies on FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED for the proposition that visa officers do not have to be satisfied that applicants under the LCP have only a temporary purpose in coming to Canada. With respect to LCP applicants, officers may be satisfied that applicants will not remain in Canada if their permanent residence application under the LCP is rejected. The Applicant says that she meets all the requirements of the LCP set out in section 112 of the Regulations so FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED applies in her case",

      "content": "[18] The Applicant also says that the Officer's finding that she would remain in Canada illegally was speculative and unreasonable. The Officer concluded that she would remain in Canada illegally because she had limited employment prospects in Colombia, she was unemployed, and because she had limited assets. These factors show that she has a desire to work in Canada, but do not show that she would remain in Canada illegally",

The Applicant's argument is based on an assertion that she meets the requirements for admission under the Live-in Caregiver class which are set out is section 112 of the Regulations. However, she does not meet these requirements. To be a member of the Live-in Caregiver class, an applicant must show that she has a job offer which has been approved by HRSDC and must submit an LMO from HRSDC. There is no evidence in this case that the Applicant submitted an LMO. This means that she did not satisfy the requirements of the LCP and could not have been granted a work permit as a member of the Live-in Caregiver class",

      "content": "[20] Because the Applicant could not and did not apply under the LCP, FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED , above, is distinguishable. That case is applicable only to applications under the LCP, so the Applicant was subject to the ordinary analysis under paragraph 200(1)( b ). The Officer was right to determine if the Applicant was likely to leave on the expiration of her work permit. He made a reasonable finding on this question when he refused the Applicant's Work Permit Application",

    {
      "content": "[21] The record appears to show that the Applicant was not considered under the Live-in Caregiver class, pursuant to section 110 of the Regulations because she did not provide an LMO from HRSDC.

    {
      "content": "[22] It seems to me that, because she did not provide an LMO, the Officer was correct to conclude that the Applicant could not qualify under the Live-in Caregiver class. The Officer makes this clear in the reasons, where he says \"wishes to go to Canada as Group Home Worker for L'Arche, exempt from an LMO (C50).\" The Applicant has questioned this aspect of the Decision and argued at the oral hearing of this matter that the LMO requirement was not authorized by the Act or the Regulations so that the Respondent's policy to require an LMO is inconsistent with the Act and the Regulations. However, paragraph 203(1)( b ) of the Regulations clearly establishes that it is: 203.

In my view, however, the need for an LMO is clearly stipulated in subsection 203(1)( b ). The Applicant had access to the current requirements when she compiled and submitted her application, and the need for an LMO was clearly stated there.

The Applicant's \"history of having contravened the conditions of admission on a previous stay in Canada\"; b. The Applicant's \"travel history\"; c.

      "content": "[28] The issue for me, then, is whether this mistake is material and renders the Decision unreasonable. In my view, this mistake is highly material because the Applicant's past conduct with regard to complying with past conditions says a great deal about whether she will comply with future conditions. In this case, the Applicant left Canada voluntarily when the time came for her to do so. She may wish to come to Canada on a permanent basis but she has demonstrated that this does not mean she will do anything illegal to achieve this end. Had the Officer not made this significant mistake his final conclusion might well have been different. Hence, I think the Decision has to be returned for reconsideration on this basis",
