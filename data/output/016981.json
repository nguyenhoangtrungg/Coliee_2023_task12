Consequently, the Court will only intervene if the decision does not fall within \"a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and the law\" ( FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED , above at paragraph 47).

The assessment of the applicants' fear must be made in concreto , and not from an abstract and general perspective ( FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED A.C.W.S. (3d) 493 at paragraph 22). With regard to the evidence in the record, the applicant has failed to meet her burden of proof to show that she would experience a personalized risk.

The applicants must meet a very high threshold in order to show that the IFA is unreasonable. As explained in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED (F.C.A.) below at paragraph 15, ... It requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant in travelling or temporarily relocating to a safe area. In addition, it requires actual and concrete evidence of such conditions. The absence of relatives in a safe place, whether taken alone or in conjunction with other factors, can only amount to such condition if it meets that threshold, that is to say if it establishes that, as a result, a claimant's life or safety would be jeopardized ",
