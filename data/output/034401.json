She stated that the family of the child's father abused her and that his brother, Anibal Sedano Fabian, treated her badly. He made amorous advances and proposed to her; these manoeuvres were refused.

The applicant explained that this was a mistake; she repeated a number of times that it was the brother of her child's father, Anibal, who was the assailant. In support of her testimony, she attempted to file copies of complaints about Anibal that she had made to the Peruvian police in 2000 and 2006.

The record contained copies of two assault and harassment complaints filed by the applicant against Anibal in 2000 and 2006 with the Peruvian police.
