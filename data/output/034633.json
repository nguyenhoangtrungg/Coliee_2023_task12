Au moment de faire la détermination citée au sous-alinéa (1), l'Organisme consultatif peut considérer tout facteur pertinent, y compris: a) si la personne a été condamnée ou autrement trouvé coupable au Canada ou à l'étranger pour les infractions suivantes: i) tout acte criminel sujet à une peine d'emprisonnement de 10 ans ou plus; ii) le trafic, la possession dans le but d'en faire le trafic, ou l'exportation ou l'importation dans le cadre de la Loi sur les drogues et substances contrôlées ; iii) tout acte criminel cité dans la partie VII du Code criminel intitulée «Maison de désordre, jeux et paris»; iv) tout acte contrevenant à une disposition de l'article 160 de la Loi sur les douanes ; v) tout acte stipulé dans la Loi sur les secrets officiels ; ou vi) tout acte stipulé dans la partie III de la Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des réfugiés . 3. si elle possède une mauvaise réputation en matière de crédit et qu'elle occupe un poste de confiance; ou 4. qu'il est probable qu'elle participe à des activités directes ou en appui à une menace ou qu'elle se livre à des actes de violence sérieuse contre la propriété ou des personnes",
