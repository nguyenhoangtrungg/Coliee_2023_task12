      "content": "[4] The applicant states that her problems began in 2006 when her daughter told her that she had become pregnant by her Jewish spouse outside of marriage. The applicant says that this news was not well received by her family because Islamic law punishes sexual relations outside marriage, and a Muslim woman is prohibited from marrying a non-Muslim",

As a result of her daughter's situation and because the applicant refused to disown her, the applicant claims that she was considered disgraced and was treated like a pariah by her neighbours and her family. She was insulted, ostracized, received death threats and was physically attacked; her house was burned down and her dog was poisoned and beaten",

The panel described some of the applicant's explanations as unreasonable and inconsistent with her actions. Furthermore, the panel observed that the applicant's explanations changed constantly in the course of her testimony.

(1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally (a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or (b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if (i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country, (ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country, (iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and (iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care. Person in need of protection (2) A person in Canada who is a member of a class of persons prescribed by the regulations as being in need of protection is also a person in need of protection. Notions d'asile, de réfugié et de personne à protéger Définition de « réfugié » 96.

The panel's findings with respect to credibility and the risks refugee claimants would face should they return to their country are subject to this standard ( FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED (CA)). Regarding the issue of an IFA, the appropriate standard of review is also reasonableness ( FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [2010] FCJ No 709; FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [2010] FCJ No 636).

The applicant maintains that, by recognizing that she was quite emotional when she testified about the problems she had to deal with in Algeria and by accepting the alleged facts as proven, the panel could not reasonably find that she was not credible.

She contends that the panel erroneously conducted a microscopic analysis of her testimony. In addition, the applicant maintains that the panel disregarded the distinction between an objective analysis by a reasonable person in the same circumstances and a subjective analysis in concreto , i.e. the state of mind of the person who is the subject of the decision. Last, the applicant states that the panel did not address some important evidence, notably, the medical certificate",

The panel also noted a number of implausibilities in her testimony, notably, that she had allowed her daughter to visit her in October 2006 despite the difficulties she was experiencing and that her daughter returned in October 2007. In addition, the respondent confirms the reasonability of the panel's finding that the difficulties the applicant experienced because of her personal situation and her status as a divorced woman do not represent harm that is sufficiently serious or repetitive to constitute a form of persecution. In response to the applicant's argument about some of the documentary evidence, the respondent submits that it is well established that analyzing the evidence and choosing the most relevant elements fall within the panel's expertise. The respondent contends that the applicant cannot ask the Court to reassess the evidence that was adduced and to substitute its opinion for the panel's",

In the Court's view, the panel's analysis cannot be characterized as imperfect, incomplete or inconsistent to the point where this Court's intervention would be warranted. On the contrary, the panel's decision is articulate and detailed. It was reasonable for the panel to reject the applicant's explanations and to find that her actions were inconsistent with her alleged fear of persecution. Moreover, the Court notes that there is a presumption that the tribunal has considered all the evidence in the record, including the medical certificate in this case ( FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED (1998) 157 FTR 35). Accordingly, the Court finds that the panel's assessment of the applicant's credibility was reasonable. b) Availability of IFA in Algiers",

The respondent submits that the onus was on the applicant to demonstrate through \"actual and concrete evidence\" that there was no internal flight alternative in Algeria, that she was at serious risk of persecution throughout her country and that it was objectively unreasonable for her to avail herself of an internal flight alternative. The respondent adds that the panel correctly applied the two-pronged test established in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED . The respondent argues that the panel carefully analyzed each of the explanations the applicant put forward to rule out the availability of an IFA and rejected each of them",

      "content": "[23] The Court is also of the view that the panel did not err in determining that an IFA existed in Algiers, a city of several million people where the applicant could blend in with the population. Moreover, according to the documentary evidence, Algiers is not one of the regions where there may be a safety risk related to terrorism (Tribunal Record, page 143). In fact, throughout his submissions to the Court, counsel for the applicant tended to link and extrapolate the daughter's situation to the impact it could have on the applicant herself. However, based on the evidence in the record, the Court cannot accept this argument (Tribunal Record, pages 78-9, 236)",
