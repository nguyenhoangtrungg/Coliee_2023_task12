The Board's analysis of the applicants' failure to claim in the U.S. as a basis of a lack of subjective fear is erroneous in fact and law. 4. The Board's negative credibility findings were as a result of factual errors and a complete misunderstanding of the evidence, ignoring relevant portions of the evidence and misunderstanding the law. 5.

In this case, the applicants' stay in the U.S. was legal (they held valid visas), was made for the purpose of arranging their entry in Canada and was brief (five days) as they intended to come to Canada where the principal applicant's aunt lived.

This fact was supported by the applicants' testimony that the police were infiltrated and that there were only three police officers in Orito for a population of 45,000.

This report therefore corroborates their submission that they were threatened. In addition, at the hearing, the interpreter verbally translated the report.

Specifically, the Board selected evidence that best supported its decision while ignoring evidence that contradicted it. For example, with regards to the evidence on groups at risk, the Board erred in not recognizing that the co-applicant falls within two of these groups: local and regional government authorities and judges and other persons involved in the administration of justice. Further, the Board relied on the omission of a paragraph on the FARC's ability to track down its victims in a 2008 report, noting that that paragraph was included in the previous 2005 report.

It was reasonable for the Board to question why the co-applicant reported the matter to the ombudsman in light of his alleged fear of the police. Further, as the co-applicant was a lawyer, it was reasonable for the Board to find that he should have known to approach a police office in Colombia; not necessarily only in Orito. His failure to report to the police was exacerbated by the fact that the principal applicant's mother did report the FARC visit to the police.

In addition, there is no reason to believe that the material cited by the applicants in their submissions was not considered in the Board's assessment of their claim. Rather, the Board expressly accepted that Colombia continues to face challenges, but nevertheless found persuasive evidence that the country is making serious efforts to rectify past problems. As such, the main issue pertains to the weighing of the evidence and whether the decision was within the range of acceptable outcomes based on the facts.

The applicants submit that this was a breach of procedural fairness. Where a decision maker relies on a document not put before the applicants, thereby eliminating their opportunity to respond, the decision may be found to have resulted from procedural unfairness (see FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [2011] FCJ No 462 at paragraphs 9, 13 and 23)",

Rather than relying on the 2009 NDP, it did actually rely on the 2010 NDP. The 2010 package was before the applicants and it is included in the applicants' record. The first document provided after the 2010 NDP list in the applicants' record is the US Department of State 2009 Human Rights Report: Colombia. This document supports the summary provided by the Board at paragraph 39 of its decision. I therefore agree with the respondent that this mistaken reference is not sufficient basis on which to set aside the Board's decision. Unlike FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED above, I do not find that the Board in this case relied on extrinsic evidence that was not put before the applicants. As such, the applicants were not denied an opportunity to respond and the decision, on this basis alone, did not result from procedural unfairness",

      "content": "[63] Further, and perhaps most notable, is the applicants' failure to seek police help after the August calls, when they had returned to Bogota. The applicants testified that they questioned the effectiveness of the police in Orito. This fear is supported by the documentary evidence, cited by the Board, which stated that FARC's presence is predominantly in southern Colombia. However, the applicants did not explain why they could not seek police protection when they returned to Bogota. This was exacerbated by the fact that the principal applicant's mother did successfully seek such protection in Bogota. The hearing testimony highlights a lack of clarity and explanation in the co-applicant's reason for not seeking police protection in Bogota: PRESIDING MEMBER: So why would you not go to the police. Your mother went to the police to tell them that the FARC was looking for you. CO-APPLICANT: The people who were threatened of death was my family and myself. She was not threatened. It was me and the members of my family. PRESIDING MEMBER: Sir you still have not answered the question. Your mother went to the police and provided the information to them that the FARC was looking for you. So why would you not go to the police. CO-APPLICANT: Because I was in the city and I was not given any kind of protection in Orito where I was respected and well-known person. If I made a denunciation in Bogota I could not take that risk because I know protection was not going to be given to me or provided to me",

Admittedly, the Board did err by relying on the original interpretation in its decision, rather than the revised interpretation provided at the hearing. However, this was not the sole reason for the Board's ultimate finding on state protection.

The two reports were written by different authors with similar acronyms. FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [2010] FCJ No 979, the Board based its internal flight alternative finding on the same discrepancy (at paragraph 12). Mr. Justice Russel Zinn explained the problem with this approach (at paragraph 31): The reports the Board referred to were not from the same organizations. The 2005 report was from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The 2008 report was from the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. These are separate entities, with different commissioners, and different mandates. The Board's error renders its conclusion that the paragraph was \"removed\" because it no longer applied perverse ",

Mr. Justice Pinard explained that the two cases were distinguishable because the board in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED above, also relied on other evidence in coming to its finding (at paragraph 13).

It is not the role of this Court to reweigh the evidence (see FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [2003] FCJ No 565 at paragraph 42).

(1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally (a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or (b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if (i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country, (ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country, (iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and (iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care. 72. (1) Le contrôle judiciaire par la Cour fédérale de toute mesure - décision, ordonnance, question ou affaire - prise dans le cadre de la présente loi est subordonné au dépôt d'une demande d'autorisation. 96.
