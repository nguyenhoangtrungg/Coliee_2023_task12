As this Court stated recently: FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [13] The Applicants challenge the Board's credibility findings with broad assertions that the Board essentially got it wrong. They say that their explanations for the matters of concern to the Board were reasonable and that the testimonial failings identified by the Board were not important. While acknowledging that there were \"problems\" with Ms. Mantilla Cortes' evidence, the Applicants contend that the Board's reasons for rejecting that testimony involve minutia and failed to address the central aspects of their allegations of persecution. FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [14] The fundamental problem with this argument is that the weaknesses in Ms. Mantilla Cortes' testimony went far beyond matters of insignificant detail. As counsel for the Respondent accurately pointed out, Ms. Mantilla Cortes was frequently inconsistent about the identity of the agents of persecution and, in that regard, gave evidence that was contradictory to the statements provided by other members of her family. The Board also noted Ms. Mantilla Cortes' vagueness about the details of the ransom allegedly paid on behalf of her brother and it identified several important omissions and inconsistencies among the various narratives provided by Ms. Mantilla Cortes and by other members of the family concerning material aspects of the alleged persecution. Finally, the Board was not impressed by Ms. Mantilla Cortes' demeanour and it specifically noted a lack of spontaneity in her responses to key questions. FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [15] It is not the role of the Court on judicial review to re-weigh the evidence or to draw its own inferences from that evidence. The Board is, after all, in the best position to assess the credibility of the witnesses who appear before it. Here the Board's credibility findings were reasonably supported by the evidence and I am, therefore, not satisfied that the Board erred in this aspect of its analysis",

No. 1533 (QL), are relevant: FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [27] The applicant did not follow up on the report she filed belatedly against her ex-spouse nor did she seek assistance from organizations that protect battered women; she simply sought refuge with family and told her in-laws what her ex-spouse had done. How can she now conclude that her country's protection was ineffective when she did not really test it seriously . FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [28] The onus was on the applicant to first seek protection from the Mexican state before asking another country for protection. She says she did not do so because she did not believe that the protection provided in Mexico for women in her situation was effective. Doubting the effectiveness of state protection when she did not really test it does not rebut the presumption of state protection in her country of origin ",
