      "content": "[39] Issue 2 Did the officer err in the assessment of the new evidence filed in the applicants' PRRA application. In the introductory paragraph of FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED above, Mr. Justice Michel Shore outlined the law on a PRRA officer's review of documentary evidence. This succinct summary bears repeating at the outset here (see FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED above, at paragraph 1): The pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA) officer has no duty to rule on each and every document in question . Contrary to what was alleged by the applicant, documentary evidence on a country is insufficient to warrant a positive risk assessment since the risk must be personal : [28] That said, the assessment of the applicant's potential risk of being persecuted if he were sent back to his country must be individualized. The fact that the documentary evidence shows that the human rights situation in a country is problematic does not necessarily mean there is a risk to a given individual ( FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED 2005 F.C. 18 (F.C.)). ( FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED (CanLII), 2005 FC 409, [2005] F.C.J. No. 506 (QL); see also FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED (CanLII), 2004 FC 133, [2004] F.C.J.

No. 1542 (QL).) Accordingly, in the case at bar, the general documentary evidence on the economic and political situation in Guinea cannot of itself establish that the protection application is valid when the connection between that evidence and the applicant himself has not been made, under both sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA. [5] In my opinion, the applicant's claim is entirely unfounded. It is settled law that an applicant must demonstrate an objective and subjective fear of persecution. In this case, it was not sufficient simply to file documentary evidence. It was necessary at the very least to establish that the applicant himself had a real fear of persecution . In the absence of such evidence, the Board members were entitled to conclude as they did. ( FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED (QL), at pp. 114 et 115 (per Marc Noël J.); see also FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [2002] F.C.J. No. 57; FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [2001] F.C.J. No. 499 (per Pierre Blais J.).) The applicant must necessarily establish a connection between the present situation in his country and his personal situation . The PRRA officer was not satisfied that the applicant had made such a connection",

The applicants filed a public statement from Amnesty International, dated September 22, 2010, calling on the new government to protect human right defenders campaigning for the return of stolen lands.

These included increased availability of state protection for civilians in Colombia and the possibility for increased safety in Bogota for those under threat, themes that were also present in the applicants' Board's decision. The following findings were included in CCR's report: 1. The urban security has improved dramatically in the last eight years; 2. The worst of the conflict has been pushed to the external regions of the country where there is a strong impact on civilians; 3. The guerrillas do not need to have many personnel in the main cities of Colombia in order to attack civilians anywhere; 4. There is still a prevalence of paramilitary groups in Colombia despite state efforts to formally reduce their numbers and to create the perception that they are demobilized; and 5.

However, Mr. Justice John Evans' well-cited statement in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED is also instructive (at paragraph 17): However, the more important the evidence that is not mentioned specifically and analyzed in the agency's reasons, the more willing a court may be to infer from the silence that the agency made an erroneous finding of fact \"without regard to the evidence\" : FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED (F.C.T.D.). In other words, the agency's burden of explanation increases with the relevance of the evidence in question to the disputed facts .

Although this Court owes significant deference to the officer's decision on this issue, I find that the officer unreasonably failed to engage with this evidence and the connection between the principal applicant's personal situation and the risks reported in the documentary evidence.
