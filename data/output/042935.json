      "content": "[2] The applicants, a married couple, are citizens of Haiti. The male applicant is a land surveyor who was appointed to Pétionville on October 28, 2009. He states that his problems started at that time. That land surveyor position in Pétionville had been vacant for thirty years while the three other land surveyor positions had been held by persons who had \"inherited\" these positions from their fathers. The other land surveyors had allegedly accused him of being appointed because of his political ties with René Préval. He purportedly started to receive death threats and was apparently followed and harassed by a criminal group supporting Jean-Bertrand Aristide (Chimères) that had been hired by the land surveyors. He allegedly asked for help from the dean of the civil tribunal in Port-au-Prince , but without success. Their situation apparently worsened after the earthquake in Haiti on January 12, 2010. The applicants were forced to live in the streets and were no longer able to protect themselves against these criminals. Furthermore, after the earthquake, the female applicant started to fear for her safety because of the possibility of sexual violence in the country's streets",

    {
      "content": "[18] The difficulty in analyzing personalized risk in situations of generalized human rights violations, civil war, and failed states lies in determining the dividing line between a risk that is \"personalized\" and one that is \"general\". Under these circumstances, the Court may be faced with applicant who has been targeted in the past and who may be targeted in the future but whose risk situation is similar to a segment of the larger population. Thus, the Court is faced with an individual who may have a personalized risk, but one that is shared by many other individuals. [14] In this case, the male applicant indicated in his PIF and testified during the hearing that he had personally been the subject of death threats and intimidation because he had been appointed by Préval. His appointment had fuelled hatred and jealousy on the part of the city's other three land surveyors, who hired the Chimères to threaten him and force him to quit his job. [15] The panel did not challenge the fact that the male applicant had been harassed by the Chimères because of his land surveyor appointment. It nevertheless found that the male applicant had not established that he faced a personalized risk: The panel is of the opinion that the risk alleged by the male claimant, should he return to his country, would not be any different than the risk faced by the entire Haitian population, which is generally confronted with a very difficult situation in a country where living conditions are characterized by poverty, theft, violence, kidnappings, a volatile situation and a lack of workers to ensure the safety of the civilian population. [16] A generalized risk is a risk that the population in general, or a significant subset of it, actually and currently faces. However, without disregard for the general situation of violence in Haiti, the male applicant actually faced a real and personal threat because of his appointment as a land surveyor, because of suspicion that this appointment had been a result of his political connections and because of the aggressive and defensive reactions of the other three land surveyors towards him as a result of this suspicion. His particular situation, actually and currently, is not generally applicable to the rest of the population or a significant subset of it. According to the documentary evidence, these specific risks are present or prospective because the male applicant's appointment was never revoked and there is therefore no reason the threat would cease to exist if he were to return to the country. [17] Therefore, the risk the male applicant faced and will likely face if he were to return to Haiti falls under the definition in subsection 97(1) of the IRPA. The panel's finding that the risk the male applicant faced after his appointment as a land surveyor is unreasonable and the Court's intervention is warranted. [18] In view of the answer to this issue, it is unnecessary to address the second issue as to whether the female applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution for rape if she were to return. However, I note that, concerning the female applicant's argument that she would be specifically targeted by criminals because of her weight, the objective documentary evidence does not support that an overweight woman is at a greater risk of being raped",
