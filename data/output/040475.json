Both administrative tribunals made findings of fact that the applicants would not be at risk. In the case at bar, the Refugee Division clearly called into question the applicants' credibility as it found, based on the applicants' behaviour over a prolonged period, that they lacked the subjective fear of persecution that was the very basis of their claim. This Court has held that where an applicant's account was found not to be credible by the Refugee Division, this account cannot serve as a basis for an argument supporting irreparable harm in a stay application: FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED (QL) ; FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED (QL) ; FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [2005] F",
