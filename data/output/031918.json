He had then applied for judicial review within the required timeframe, namely, within 30 days of the decision (subsection 18.1(2) of the Federal Courts Act ). After hearing the case on its merits, the Court dismissed the application for judicial review. The facts raised in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED do not apply in the present matter because the second level decision was issued within a reasonable timeframe; the application for judicial does not concern the second level decision; and the goal of the application filed by the applicant in the present case was to accelerate the third level decision",

In that case, the Court found that, in light of evidence indicating that the CSC had not acted independently and that other government agencies had dictated its decisions, the circumstances warranted an exception to the general rule that internal remedies should be exhausted beforehand. Consequently, the Court determined that the application for judicial review was appropriate. However, in the case at bar, the evidence does not demonstrate that the CSC was influenced by another agency and, consequently, did not act independently.
