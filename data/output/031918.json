He had then applied for judicial review within the required timeframe, namely, within 30 days of the decision (subsection 18.1(2) of the Federal Courts Act ). After hearing the case on its merits, the Court dismissed the application for judicial review.

Consequently, the Court determined that the application for judicial review was appropriate. However, in the case at bar, the evidence does not demonstrate that the CSC was influenced by another agency and, consequently, did not act independently.
