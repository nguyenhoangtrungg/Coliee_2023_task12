She says their marriage went well until the birth of their first daughter in February 1974. Owochei was not satisfied because their daughter was not a boy and began quarrelling with the Applicant. Their first daughter died in 1976. After the birth of their second daughter in 1979, Owochei began physically abusing the Applicant and slapping her two to three times per week. After the birth of their third daughter in 1982, the abuse escalated to include punching and flogging with an electric wire. The couple's fourth daughter was born in March 1988 and the abuse continued. After a particularly brutal beating, the Applicant's parents brought the situation to the attention of the village elders, but Owochei refused their orders to stop. He was exiled from the community but returned later. In 1991, the Applicant gave birth to a son, followed by two more sons in 1993 and 1995, all of whom Owochei fathered",

The Applicant brought her youngest son with her but left the other children in the care of their father. Owochei frequently went to the store in front of her parents' house. At the hearing, the Applicant said that she did not encounter Owochei directly during this period because neighbours would alert her when he approached the house, allowing her to hide or flee before he arrived",

Another tenant opened the door and noticed that Owochei was carrying a cutlass; he alerted the Applicant, who hid. Owochei forced his way into the house and ransacked the Applicant's room.

At the hearing, the Applicant said that she did not see Owochei after leaving the marital home, but would hear him \"physically abuse\" her by using words when he visited the store in front of her parents' house.

The RPD found that if Owochei had wanted to have direct contact with the Applicant in the small village, he could have done so easily, and that he did not physically abuse her after she left the marital home in 2005.

The RPD found that it would be highly unlikely, if not impossible, that she would not have run into any of them over a period of three-and-a-half years in such a small area.

The interpretation must be precise, continuous, competent, impartial and contemporaneous. b. No proof of actual prejudice is required as a condition of obtaining relief. c. The right is to adequate translation not perfect translation. The fundamental value is linguistic understanding. d. Waiver of the right results if an objection to the quality of the translation is not raised by a claimant at the first opportunity in those cases where it is reasonable to expect that a complaint be made. e.

There was no evidence before the RPD that her children would want to visit her. The children of an abused woman might feel ambivalence to their mother for a number of reasons, including the influence of the abusive parent, their feelings of being abandoned or unprotected, or uncertainty about whether they should seek out the abused parent.

The Respondent quotes FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED where Justice Denis Pelletier said at paragraphs 17 and 18 that The Guidelines are an aid for the CRDD panel in the assessment of the evidence of women who allege that they have been victims of gender-based persecution. The Guidelines do not create new grounds for finding a person to be a victim of persecution. To that extent, the grounds remain the same, but the question becomes whether the panel was sensitive to the factors which may influence the testimony of women who have been the victims of persecution [...] The Guidelines cannot be treated as corroborating any evidence of gender-based persecution so that the giving of the evidence becomes proof of its truth",

For the RPD, there is a clear distinction between physical abuse and verbal abuse and this is enough for it to conclude that \"her responses to this major material contradiction are inadequate and unreasonable.\" The RPD makes a specific finding that the husband \"did not come and physically abuse her after she left the marital home in 2005, and this is a very serious contradiction which impugns her overall credibility.\" This finding is extremely important for the overall negative credibility finding. There is, however, no evidence that she ran away from her parents' home for any other reason; if the RPD accepted that she was running away, it is reasonable to expect that it would pay close attention to the Applicant's explanation that she did not change her story from physical abuse to verbal abuse",

The relevant portions of the transcript read as follows: Q. So what was your life like when you lived at your parent's. [ sic ] A. My situation was pathetic because I felt like I was homeless, I couldn't (inaudible) the homes, but this was me now dealing with my parents (inaudible) to survive. Q. And did you have contact with your husband. A. No, we didn't have contact; I didn't see him anymore. Q. So when was the last time you saw your husband. A. Right from the day I left his house I did not see him (inaudible). Q. Now, in your personal information form, on page 3, you're talking about when you lived at your parent's [ sic ] house and you wrote: \"My husband did not leave me alone at my parent's [ sic ] house. On many occasions he visited me there and at the store and physically abused me\". That's very different from what you just told me. I'm sorry, please wait until our interpreter translates. I said that's very different from what you just told me. Let him translate and then you can tell me more. A. So what happened was that I never saw him after that but there were many times that he came to the store where I was doing my petty trade and people who recognized him will call and say my husband was coming and I will run away, so that I don't get beaten and get harassed. Q. Okay, there's still something there that I don't understand what you wrote and I want to make sure you understand it. You wrote: \"On many occasions he visited me there\" - - that's referring to your parent's [ sic ] house. \"He visited me there and at the store and physically abused me\". A. Madam, the scenario was this; the store being in front of the house and were other rooms behind the store. When they came to told me that my husband was coming I will escape, I go to the back and here him physically abuse - - abusing - - like using words, in the store and said whenever - - whenever he sees me he was going to do this, he was going to do that; that was the physical abuse that I was referring to. But to see him, I didn't see him. Q. Okay, I want to tell you something, I've been a member of this Board for seven years, I've done many claims of women who say that their husbands were abusing them. I have never heard someone say physically abuse me to mean anything else than the person hit me or beat me in some way. A. Madam, my story still remains same the way that I said it the first day. Maybe it was put down in that form by the interpreter who wrote it, but that was the story that I remember happened because that was what happened. Q. Okay. It's very difficult for me to read that your - - what you wrote was that your husband did not leave you alone and that he physically abused you and now you're telling me that you never saw him again after you left his home or the home where you had lived in 2005. A. The way I spoke to this interpreter is the way I'm speaking to you. He will come, yes, he will make noise, use his hands and beat the door and shout abuses and insults, yes, I didn't see him. He came to my parent's [ sic ] home, yes; I didn't see him because before he'd come to where we were word would have come to me that my husband was coming, my husband was coming, because everybody knew what I went through in his hands and the moment they saw him coming towards my parent's [ sic ] place always (inaudible) that he was coming and I would just run behind and people would tell him that I'm not there, I'm not there. I heard him raise his voice, I heard him, you know, shout and threaten and abuse, that's exactly what I said to the interpreter when I spoke (inaudible)",

Her PIF was interpreted to her in Yoruba by a Yoruba interpreter, while at the hearing an Igbo interpreter was used; this interpreter told the RPD that Igbo and Yoruba are \"extremely different.\" The Applicant speaks both languages, but it is clear that Igbo is her most comfortable language because a pre-hearing was held to determine what kind of interpreter was required for the hearing and the RPD decided to proceed with the Igbo interpreter.
