      "content": "[16] With its expertise, the Board is the tribunal in the best position to weigh the facts, particularly when it is a matter of assessing the witnesses’ credibility and the evidence filed with regard to the definition of Convention refugee. There is no longer any doubt that the Refugee Division, which is a specialized tribunal, has complete jurisdiction to determine the plausibility of testimony: who is in a better position than the Refugee Division to gauge the credibility of an account and to draw the necessary inferences. As long as the inferences drawn by the tribunal are not so unreasonable as to warrant our intervention, its findings are not open to judicial review. In Giron, the Court merely observed that in the area of plausibility, the unreasonableness of a decision may be more palpable, and so more easily identifiable, since the account appears on the face of the record. In our opinion, Giron in no way reduces the burden that rests on an appellant, of showing that the inferences drawn by the Refugee Division could not reasonably have been drawn. In this case, the appellant has not discharged this burden. ( FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED (QL), at paragraph 4)",

      "content": "[31] On that point, Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer said the following in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED (QL), at paragraph 10: The lack of evidence going to the subjective element of the claim is a fatal flaw which in and of itself warrants dismissal of the claim, since both elements of the refugee definition–subjective and objective–must be met",

      "content": "[32] Accordingly, Mr. Modernell Gilgorri and his family did not establish that they had a subjective fear of persecution if they were to return to Uruguay.

On the other hand, where a state is in effective control of its territory, has military, police and civil authority in place, and makes serious efforts to protect its citizens from terrorist activities, the mere fact that it is not always successful at doing so will not be enough to justify a claim that the victims of terrorism are unable to avail themselves of such protection.

The test was clearly reiterated by Beaudry J. FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED v. (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2005] F.C.J. No. 463, at paragraph 11: FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED (C.A.) at paragraph 2, the Federal Court of Appeal listed two elements to be considered when establishing an IFA: the Board must be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists, and, taking into account all the circumstances, including those specific to the applicant, the situation in the proposed location must be such that it would not be unreasonable for the applicant to seek shelter there",
