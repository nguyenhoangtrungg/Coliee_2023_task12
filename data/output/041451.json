[Translation]: This is an application for judicial review, pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act , S.C. 2001 c. 27, of a decision of an immigration officer (the officer), dated December 9, 2009, rejecting the visa application of Ghada Abboud (the applicant) on the ground that she had not provided the information that had been asked of her. The officer also later dismissed the applicant's request to have this decision reassessed",

      "content": "[4] On May 27, 2009, the application was transferred to the Canadian Embassy in Warsaw for fast-tracking. On July 29, 2009, the officer sent an e-mail consisting of a letter, dated July 28, 2009, to her counsel's e-mail address. The letter informed the applicant that the application would be processed in Warsaw and requested that she submit certain additional documents within a fixed time period or risk having her application rejected",

The officer, for his part, claims that he received an automated message to the effect that his \"message has been successfully relayed to the following recipients, but the requested delivery status notifications may not be generated by the destination\" (this was followed by the lawyer's e-mail address)",

The officer refused this request and the applicant then commenced the current judicial review proceeding",

      "content": "[9] The applicant produced three \"exhibits\" which, in her view, show that the automated message received by the officer is an indication of the fact that the message he sent to her counsel never reached its destination. This view is supported by the affidavit of an Ottawa computer specialist, which Justice Michel Shore allowed to be submitted in support of the application for judicial review. At the hearing the respondent conceded that the evidence submitted by the applicant was convincing in this regard",

FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED , at para. 100, Justice Binnie, writing for the majority of the Supreme Court, noted that \"[i] t is for the courts ... to provide the answer to procedural fairness questions\". Thus, if the officer breached the duty of procedural fairness owed to the applicant, the Court must intervene. In my view, that is the case here",

      "content": "[12] As for the case at bar, the Court is not convinced that the request for additional information was in fact sent to the applicant. At the hearing, both parties agreed on the fact that the automated response sent to the officer (DSN or \"Delivery Status Notification\") indicating that the message \"has been successfully relayed\" did not constitute proof that the message had actually reached its destination. At most, this type of notification indicates that the e-mail was sent to the server, which does not necessarily mean that the message was in fact accessible in the counsel's e-mail inbox",

      "content": "[13] Moreover, if the officer was sure that the message had been properly sent the first time, we might wonder why he thought it necessary to send a second e-mail containing exactly the same information only a few hours later. The fact that another \"DSN\" was received should have alerted him that the messages had not been sent successfully",

In that case, the documentary evidence clearly showed that the letter had never been received by the applicant or by her representative, either by mail or by fax. At para. 19, the judge noted that: It is reasonable to expect that there will be mistakes by the respondent when dealing with thousands of immigration files. When the evidence shows that there has been such a mistake the Court would have expected the respondent cure the mistake, i.e. invite the applicant to attend another interview",
