A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion, (a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or (b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country. Définition de « réfugié » 96. A qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention - le réfugié - la personne qui, craignant avec raison d'être persécutée du fait de sa race, de sa religion, de sa nationalité, de son appartenance à un groupe social ou de ses opinions politiques: a) soit se trouve hors de tout pays dont elle a la nationalité et ne peut ou, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de chacun de ces pays; b) soit, si elle n'a pas de nationalité et se trouve hors du pays dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, ne peut ni, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut y retourner. Person in need of protection 97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally ( a ) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or ( b ) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if (i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country, (ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country, (iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and (iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care. Person in need of protection (2) A person in Canada who is a member of a class of persons prescribed by the regulations as being in need of protection is also a person in need of protection. Personne à protéger 97. (1) A qualité de personne à protéger la personne qui se trouve au Canada et serait personnellement, par son renvoi vers tout pays dont elle a la nationalité ou, si elle n'a pas de nationalité, dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, exposée: a) soit au risque, s'il y a des motifs sérieux de le croire, d'être soumise à la torture au sens de l'article premier de la Convention contre la torture; b) soit à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités dans le cas suivant: (i) elle ne peut ou, de ce fait, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de ce pays, (ii) elle y est exposée en tout lieu de ce pays alors que d'autres personnes originaires de ce pays ou qui s'y trouvent ne le sont généralement pas, (iii) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de sanctions légitimes - sauf celles infligées au mépris des normes internationales - et inhérents à celles-ci ou occasionnés par elles, (iv) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de l'incapacité du pays de fournir des soins médicaux ou de santé adéquats.

The term \"drug trafficking\" was a clarification made at the hearing in relation to his PIF. In that sense, the applicant submits that the panel's decision was so blatantly arbitrary and illogical that it vitiated its reasoning (Applicant's Record, detailed affidavit of the applicant at paragraphs 17-18 and Certified Tribunal Record, decision of the panel at paragraphs 10-11).

In fact, the applicant is asking this Court to re-assess the evidence that was submitted before the panel and to substitute its own interpretation of it in the context of a judicial review, which is not the role of this Court.

No. 742, at paragraph 24). The Court already relied on this principle in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED , above, at paragraph 19, a case that contains facts similar to those in this case: [19] Last, this Court has also repeatedly confirmed that the RPD can draw an adverse inference from the lack of evidence corroborating a claimant's testimony where the panel has concerns about his or her credibility. The applicants had to properly document their alleged fear of persecution. In this case, the applicant did not provide any evidence to corroborate her place of residence during the period of alleged risk and did not even specify in her PIF where she lived during that period. It was therefore not unreasonable for the RPD to expect the applicants to provide credible evidence to corroborate the allegations that were at the heart of their claim and were the very foundation of their fear of persecution, given that the onus was on them to credibly establish their allegations in support of that fear, which they failed to do in this case",

Moreover, as noted by the panel, if he had approached the Mexican consulate in Canada, he would have been able to obtain it free of charge within four (4) to six (6) weeks.
