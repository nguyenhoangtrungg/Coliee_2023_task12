According to the notes in the Computer Assisted Immigration Processing System (CAIPS), the decision of the visa officer was based on the following statements made by the applicant at his interview: (1) The applicant allegedly stated that he did not know when he would return to Syria and later mentioned that he would remain in Canada for approximately five to seven years; (2) The applicant allegedly planned on living in Canada with his family during this period and in fact had applied for temporary resident visas for his wife and two children; (3) The applicant allegedly intended to sell his house in Syria and buy one in Canada",

First, it is corroborated by the notes she recopied into the CAIPS system, which make absolutely no mention of problems communicating with the applicant, whereas there is nothing to support or confirm the applicant’s allegations. Further, the officer’s notes were re-transcribed into the CAIPS the day after the interview with the applicant, namely March 21, 2001, when the events were still fresh in her memory, and the applicant’s affidavit, on the other hand, dates from August 31, 2001, over five months after the interview. In my opinion the fact that the CAIPS notes, which corroborate the officer’s testimony, were contemporaneous is a sufficient reason to prefer her testimony to that of the applicant",

Although there was no obligation to do so, the Visa Officer did express her misgivings and invited the applicant to provide further documentation to persuade her that his wealth was not gleaned from illegitimate sources. Unfortunately, the applicant said he had no further information. I attach greater weight to the Visa Officer’s affidavit about what took place during the interview because the CAIPS entries were done the same day and there is no mention that the applicant would have the opportunity to submit further documentation ( FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [2002] F",

An allegation of bias, especially actual and not simply apprehended bias, against a tribunal is a serious allegation. It challenges the integrity of the tribunal and of its members who participated in the impugned decision. It cannot be done lightly. It cannot rest on mere suspicion, pure conjecture, insinuations or mere impressions of an applicant or his counsel.
