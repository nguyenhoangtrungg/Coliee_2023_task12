      "content": "[10] The standard of judicial review that is applicable to the denial of an H&C application by an officer is that of reasonableness, and has not changed since the Supreme Court's decision in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED ) that an immigration officer will use the discretionary authority conferred under subsection 25(1) of the Act to allow a foreign national to file an application for permanent residency in Canada. An applicant without status on Canadian soil remains a foreign national under the Act. Consequently, without the exemption sought in this case, such an applicant must apply from outside Canada, as required under the Act",

They refer to FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED and stress the decision-maker's obligation to be alert, alive and sensitive to the child's best interests . However, the Court cannot ignore the fact that this decision nonetheless recognizes that even though a great deal of weight is given to the child's best interests, based on the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED , these interests are not necessarily the determining factor in every case. In other words, mere mention of the child is not enough. The child's interests remain one of several factors to be carefully reviewed and weighed",

      "content": "[15] To expect a different decision from the officer, she would have had to know in concrete terms how and why the grandson's best interests would be better served by the continuous presence of his grandparents. It was not enough for the son and daughter-in-law of the applicants to support their application and state that \"We rely on our parents for moral support and we are a close and loving family. As we are planning to soon have children, we feel it is very important for our children to know, and grow up close to their grandparents\". There should have been some concrete demonstration of what this support entailed, which might have allowed the officer to be more \"alert, alive and sensitive\" than she was when presented with poorly substantiated evidence",

      "content": "[16] Other than informing the officer of their civil status, their extended family, and very little about their personal situation, the applicants were far from forthcoming in explaining what their past, current and future contribution involved in terms of providing \"moral support\" to their son Ricardo's family. At the time of reviewing their file, the officer contacted the applicants to give them the opportunity to expand on it. That was when she learned of the birth of the grandson. Had it not been for that phone call, the evidence would not even have included the addition of a grandson to the applicants' extended family",

The applicants cannot reproach the officer for having failed to be alert, alive and sensitive to nonexistent factual evidence when it was up to them to provide the evidence in support of their claims ( FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED ).

      "content": "[21] The applicants argue, furthermore, that the officer's decision disregards the main objective of their application, which is family reunification. Accepting this rationale would amount to saying that all foreign nationals visiting Canada to keep in touch with their children and grandchildren settled in Canada should be admitted simply to provide moral support to their children and grandchildren, without having to demonstrate that applying for permanent residency from abroad would expose them to unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship. This is certainly not the goal of the Act when it provides that in exceptional circumstances and for very specific reasons, the officer may grant an exemption from the requirement to make an application for permanent residency from abroad",
