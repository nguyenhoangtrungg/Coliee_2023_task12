No. 485, at paragraph 19, Mr. Justice Russell of this Court considered the applicable standard of review for a citizenship judge's finding as to whether a person applying for citizenship meets the residence requirement:",
      "year": 2010

    {
      "content": "[19] There has been general consensus in the jurisprudence of this Court that the applicable standard of review for a citizenship judge's determination of whether an applicant meets the residency requirement, which is a question of mixed fact and law, is reasonableness simpliciter ( Canada (Minister of Citizenship and FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED ). In light of the Supreme Court of Canada's recent decision in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [ FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED ], wherein the Court collapsed this standard and the patent unreasonableness standards into one standard of reasonableness, I find that the applicable standard of review as regards the Citizenship Judge's determination of whether the Applicant met the residency requirement is reasonableness. [16] However, the lack of adequate reasons to support the decision is a procedural fairness issue. As this Court has repeatedly stressed, where the Court is seized with a procedural fairness or natural justice issue, the appropriate standard of review is correctness (see FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [2009] F.C.J. No. 875, at paragraph 29). Analysis [17] In this case, the designated period is between December 14, 2003, and December 14, 2007. During these four years immediately preceding her application for citizenship, Ms. Abou-Zahra alleges that she spent a total of 109 days outside of Canada and 1,351 days in Canada. [18] The legal test that applies on citizenship appeals is set out in subsection 5(1) of the Act. However, the term \"residence\" is not defined. As Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer explained clearly in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [2007] F.C.J. No. 947, at paragraphs 10-13, the jurisprudence of this Court has interpreted the term \"residence\" in three different ways: [10] . . . This Court's interpretation of \"residence\" can be grouped into three categories. The first views it as actual, physical presence in Canada for a total of three years, calculated on the basis of a strict counting of days ( Pourghasemi (Re) , [1993] F.C.J. No. 232 (QL) (T.D.)). A less stringent reading of the residence requirement recognizes that a person can be resident in Canada, even while temporarily absent, so long as he or she maintains a strong attachment to Canada ( Antonios E. Papadogiorgakis (Re) , [1978] 2 F.C. 208 (T.D.). A third interpretation, similar to the second, defines residence as the place where one \"regularly, normally or customarily lives\" or has \"centralized his or her mode of existence\" ( Koo (Re) , 1992 CanLII 2417 (F.C.), [1993] 1 F.C. 286 (T.D.) at para. 10). [11] I essentially agree with Justice James O'Reilly in Nandre , above, at paragraph 11 that the first test is a test of physical presence, while the other two tests involve a more qualitative assessment: Clearly, the Act can be interpreted two ways, one requiring physical presence in Canada for three years out of four, and another requiring less than that so long as the applicant's connection to Canada is strong. The first is a physical test and the second is a qualitative test. [12] It has also been recognized that any of these three tests may be applied by a Citizenship Judge in making a citizenship determination ( FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED (T.D.) (QL)). For instance, in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [2001] F.C.J. No. 862 (QL), Justice Elizabeth Heneghan at paragraph 4 concludes that any of the three tests may be applied in making a residency determination: The case law on citizenship appeals has clearly established that there are three legal tests which are available to determine whether an applicant has established residence within the requirements of the Citizenship Act (...) a Citizenship Judge may adopt either the strict count of days, consideration of the quality of residence or, analysis of the centralization of an applicant's mode of existence in this country. [Citations omitted] [13] While a Citizenship Judge may choose to rely on any one of the three tests, it is not open to him or her to \"blend\" the tests ( Tulupnikov, above, at para. 16). [19] However, it should be noted that recently the jurisprudence of this Court on this issue was clarified following the decision of Mr. Justice Mainville in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED F.C.J. No. 1371 and the decision of Mr. Justice Zinn in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED F.C.J. No. 330. I agree with those decisions",

      "content": "[20] Thus, as Justice Zinn explained in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED , where a citizenship judge finds that an applicant was physically present in Canada for at least 1,095 days-the required minimum period-residence is proven, and resort to the more contextual Koo test is unnecessary: Koo (Re) (T.D.) [1992] F.C.J. No. 1107, [1993] 1 F.C. 286 . The Koo test need only be relied on where the applicant has been resident in Canada but has been physically present in Canada for less than 1,095 days. In that situation, citizenship judges must apply the Koo test to determine whether the applicant was resident in Canada, even though not physically present here (see also Canada (The Minister of Citizenship and FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [2010] F",

In her Application for Canadian Citizenship , Ms. Abou-Zahra stated that she had been absent from Canada from June 20, 2007, to July 24, 2007; from September 15, 2006, to October 14, 2006; from August 1, 2004, to September 16, 2004; and from May 22, 2003, to July 15, 2003.

The evidence in the record reveals that Ms. Abou Zahra did not submit all the passports. She also provided only partial copies of the passports that were submitted. For instance, the Court notes that the passport issued to her in Beirut, Lebanon, on November 2, 1998-the validity of which was extended to October 20, 2008-has significant parts of pages missing, i.e. pages 6 and 7 and 12 to 43. Also, Ms. Abou Zahra did not mention any absence from Canada prior to 2003 whereas the evidence indicates that she was absent in 1995 at the very least because she gave birth to her son in Lebanon (Tribunal Record at page 71)",
