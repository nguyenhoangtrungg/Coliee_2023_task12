A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion, (a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or (b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country. Person in need of protection 97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally (a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or (b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if (i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country, (ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country, (iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and (iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care. Person in need of protection (2) A également qualité de personne à protéger la personne qui se trouve au Canada et fait partie d'une catégorie de personnes auxquelles est reconnu par règlement le besoin de protection. Définition de « réfugié » 96. A qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention - le réfugié - la personne qui, craignant avec raison d'être persécutée du fait de sa race, de sa religion, de sa nationalité, de son appartenance à un groupe social ou de ses opinions politiques: a) soit se trouve hors de tout pays dont elle a la nationalité et ne peut ou, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de chacun de ces pays; b) soit, si elle n'a pas de nationalité et se trouve hors du pays dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, ne peut ni, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut y retourner. Personne à protéger 97. (1) A qualité de personne à protéger la personne qui se trouve au Canada et serait personnellement, par son renvoi vers tout pays dont elle a la nationalité ou, si elle n'a pas de nationalité, dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, exposée: a) soit au risque, s'il y a des motifs sérieux de le croire, d'être soumise à la torture au sens de l'article premier de la Convention contre la torture; b) soit à une menace à sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusités dans le cas suivant: (i) elle ne peut ou, de ce fait, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de ce pays, (ii) elle y est exposée en tout lieu de ce pays alors que d'autres personnes originaires de ce pays ou qui s'y trouvent ne le sont généralement pas, (iii) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de sanctions légitimes - sauf celles infligées au mépris des normes internationales - et inhérents à celles-ci ou occasionnés par elles, (iv) la menace ou le risque ne résulte pas de l'incapacité du pays de fournir des soins médicaux ou de santé adéquats.

In its decision, the Board, according to her, wrongfully determined that since criminal gang violence is a risk generally faced by the population in St. Vincent, the risk she faced was a generalized one. A generalized risk does not automatically mean that the particular risk faced by a refugee claimant is one that is generally faced by the citizens of a country. The case at hand, according to Ms Samuel's counsel, contains similarities with the decision of this Court in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [ FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED ]. In FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED , the Court concluded that, since the Applicant was subjected to repeated threats and attacks, he was subjected to a greater risk than the risk faced by the population at large. Ms. Samuel affirms that her particularized risk in St. Vincent amounts to a greater risk.

The Supreme Court of Canada identified three potential categories of social groups in Ward, supra : (1) Groups defined by an innate, unchangeable characteristic; (2) Groups whose members voluntarily associate for reasons so fundamental to their human dignity that they should not be forced to forsake the association; (3) Groups associated by a former voluntary status, unalterable due to its historical permanence. ... [ 25 ] Case law from this Court has consistently established that the fear of reprisals motivated by vengeance and being a victim of a criminal act are not equivalent to a persecution ground under section 96: FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED online: FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED online: FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED . Victims of criminal acts therefore do not belong to a particular social group. [26] In light of the categories identifying social groups in Ward, supra, I disagree with the applicant and do not find that the Board erred in deciding that his father, a Pakistani police officer who was called to testify as a prosecution witness, was not persecuted within the meaning of section 96 of the Act, since he was not a member of an identifiable social group",

Unfortunately for the claimant, however, all of counsel's word additions beyond 'women in St. Vincent and the Grenadines' refer to patently non-innate and changeable characteristics.

They are not trial de novo proceedings whereby determination of new issues can be made on the basis of freshly adduced evidence. As Rothstein J.A. said in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED (FCA). This is the reason why, barring exceptional circumstances such as bias or jurisdictional questions, which may not appear on the record, the reviewing Court is bound by and limited to the record that was before the judge or the Board. Fairness to the parties and the court or tribunal under review dictates such a limitation.

The tests proposed in Mayers, supra, Cheung, supra, and Matter of Acosta, supra, provide a good working rule to achieve this result. They identify three possible categories: (1) groups defined by an innate or unchangeable characteristic; (2) groups whose members voluntarily associate for reasons so fundamental to their human dignity that they should not be forced to forsake the association; and (3) groups associated by a former voluntary status, unalterable due to its historical permanence. The first category would embrace individuals fearing persecution on such bases as gender, linguistic background and sexual orientation, while the second would encompass, for example, human rights activists. The third branch is included more because of historical intentions, although it is also relevant to the anti-discrimination influences, in that one's past is an immutable part of the person",
