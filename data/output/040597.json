The applicant wanted to know why these expenses were denied, which triggered a series of reviews of all his tax returns, leading to the following results: (a) letter dated April 8, 2005, from Ms. Martine Bérubé regarding the tax returns for the years 1996 to 2000, informing him that the respondent intended to make the following correction: to disallow the business loss of $16,592, which had been allowed in 2004 for the years 1996 to 2000; (b) letter dated July 8, 2005, from Ms. Marie Josée Kroft confirming the decision to disallow the business loss of $16,592. This letter states that it could not be determined from the information and documents submitted by the applicant that these expenses were incurred for the sole purpose of earning business income; (c) notice of assessment dated September 1, 2005, for the year 2000 did not include the expenses claimed as business losses; (d) review of the file by Mr. Robert Villemure who concluded on December 1, 2005, that the decision was reasonable and advised that it should be upheld; (e) decision by Mr. Marchand on December 2, 2005, confirming the refusal to accept the applicant’s business losses.

Consequently, taxpayers play a decisive role, and the state assumes that citizens can take on this responsibility and the obligations inherent in it. 47 To discharge this responsibility properly, citizens, particularly business operators, must put in place an accounting system that makes it possible to identify exactly which revenues are taxable.
