The Board noted the principal applicant's testimony that he had not gone into self-confinement after the feud was declared even though this was what male family members generally did when a blood feud was declared against them. This was exacerbated by the Board's finding that his parents could have operated the bar instead of the principal applicant putting himself at risk in so doing. Further, the Board noted that there was no evidence that the two men who had accosted him at the bar did any physical harm to him after the altercation.

The Board found that this example provided a clear manifestation of a functioning crimes court, that blood feud killers were not let off or given light sentences, that an effective legislation and procedural framework existed and that there was both the capacity and will to effectively implement that framework.

The first step assesses whether an issue of human rights or discrimination is engaged. The applicants submit that this first step is satisfied in this case because the right to freely choose one's partner and to form a family are fundamental human rights articulated in international instruments. The second step requires determining whether the persecution is caused by membership in the particular social group in issue. The applicants submit that they are being targeted due to their marriage and formation of a family contrary to Kanun law.

The respondent highlights that male members of a family are at risk when a blood feud is declared against the family. However, in this case, the blood feud was directed at the principal applicant and his wife. In addition, as noted by the Board, the principal applicant's actions in returning to work after the blood feud was declared were not consistent with the risk he allegedly feared.

At paragraph 41, the Court concluded that: Revenge killing in a blood feud has nothing to do with the defence of human rights -- quite to the contrary, such killings constitute a violation of human rights. Families engaged in them do not form a particular social group for Convention purposes.

The facts in this case are not based purely on criminality, revenge or personal vendetta (see FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED above, at paragraph 40).

As such, I find that the applicants fall within the scope of the \"particular social group\" category described by the Supreme Court as \"groups defined by an innate or unchangeable characteristic\", and to a lesser extent also the category of \"groups whose members voluntarily associate for reasons so fundamental to their human dignity that they should not be forced to forsake the association\" (see Ward above, at paragraph 70). Further, unlike the applicant in Ward above, whose fear arose due to his actions, the fear of persecution faced by the applicants in this case arose specifically due to their association in a social group of individuals that marry contrary to the Karun (see Ward above, at paragraph 79)",

This is particularly important in light of the established law that the availability of state protection must be assessed on a case-by-case basis (see FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [2010] FCJ No 132 at paragraph 33). This failure is exacerbated by recent documentary evidence that speaks to the lack of protection that the Albanian state and police provide to families involved in blood feuds. According to this documentation, \"the Albanian police often do not get involved in blood-feud disputes until a crime has taken place\". The example highlighted by the Board supports this position, namely, that the police did not become involved until after the crime was committed. Collectively, this raises serious concerns about the state protection available to the applicants in Albania prior to any harm being caused to them",

Findings must also be supported by reasons written in \"clear and unmistakable terms\" (see FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED ). In reviewing a board's decision, isolated sections should not be scrutinized; rather, the Court must consider whether the decision as a whole supports a board's negative credibility finding (see FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [2010] FCJ No 1365 at paragraph 30).

After the blood feud was declared, the principal applicant returned to work rather than remaining in self-confinement; 2. The principal applicant's reason for returning to work (to provide for his family) was nonsensical given his parents were available to attend at the bar; and 3. The two men who accosted the principal applicant at work did not physically harm him on the way to or from the bar after the altercation",

      "content": "[61] These findings ignore other relevant aspects of the applicants' submissions. For example, the principal applicant testified that although he returned to work after the couple's marriage, he was accosted only two days later at the bar. He had initially believed that his wife's family would not harm them once they were married, but this incident led him to reconsider the threat and thereafter enter self-confinement. The principal applicant also testified that when the incident occurred, customers who knew him came to assist him: Everybody was involved to see what is going on and possibly help me and these were the people that actually sent me home right away. Because they could see that I was not safe",

As such, the Board's reliance on the lack of post-incident harm, events on which it did not question the principal applicant at the hearing, is a questionable basis for its credibility finding",
