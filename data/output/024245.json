The real question as to the validity of the new constitution then seems to be one of political, not legal, legitimacy: is the constitution based on a majority consensus of those who, on the existing evidence, appear to be members of the Band. This is a question which a court should not seek to answer in the absence of some discernable legal criteria which it can apply.

I agree with this characterization of a band’s custom. However, determining what is generally acceptable to members of the band gives rise to difficulties, as is exemplified by this litigation. Justice Strayer further stated the validity of the constitution in that case was a question of political legitimacy, and was a question the court should not seek to answer in the absence of some “discernible legal criteria”. ¶ 28 The Respondents submitted that the objective legal criteria sought by Justice Strayer could be found in subsection 2(3)( a ) of the Indian Act . This section reads as follows: 2. (3) Unless the context otherwise requires or this Act otherwise provides, ( a ) a power conferred on a band shall be deemed not to be exercised unless it is exercised pursuant to the consent of a majority of the electors of the band; and . . . ¶ 29 The Respondents submitted that it is the Band that has the power to determine what the constitution, or electoral procedures, of the Band are, and that this power must be exercised in accordance with subsection 2(3)( a ), as set out supra . I agree that it is the Band itself, not the Band Council, that has the power to determine what constitutes the Band's custom. However, I disagree with the Respondents’ submission that this is a “power conferred on a band” as is contemplated by subsection 2(3)( a ) of the Indian Act ",

By the same logic, I do not think it was necessary for the Council to proceed by referendum in order to ensure that it had the support of a majority of the public before adopting the Electoral Code.

It is not disputed that the election was held in accordance with the Code, and following the election the Election Appeal Board was appointed in accordance with the Code and adjudicated the Applicant’s appeal in a manner consistent with the Code. In fact, everything seemed to transpire in accordance with the Code until the Elections Appeal Board rendered its order, at which time the Respondents refused to comply with the order",

      "content": "[43] Faced with evidence that supported “no more than a weak inference that the Code received the support of the Band membership”, Heald D.J. turned to the election which followed adoption of the Code, concluding as follows at paragraphs 64 and 65 of his decision: I think the answer is to be found in the conduct of the Band in relation to the March 14, 1994, election and the events that followed. The Band conducted the nomination proceedings, the election and the subsequent election appeal, all in accordance with the Code. According to the Affidavit of the Respondent Hall, there were 478 votes cast for the election of the Band Chief. Although neither party led evidence as to the total number of eligible voters at the time of the election, the Respondent Hall deposed that at the time of the plebiscites there were 964 Band members of voting age, including non-residents. Thus, it can be said that approximately 50 % of the eligible voters participated in the March 14, 1994 election. There is no evidence that at any time before or during the election any Band member objected to the manner in which the election by Band custom was proceeding. In my view, the conduct of the Band in acquiescing in the use of the Code, is sufficient evidence to satisfy the requirement of Justice Strayer, as set out in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED , that it was “generally acceptable to members of the band, upon which there is a broad consensus”, and therefore reflects the Band’s custom. ¶ 65 Accordingly, I declare that the Code was in force as of March 14, 1994",

Accordingly, I am satisfied that the community’s acquiescence in use of the Electoral Code in the 2005 elections is sufficient evidence to establish that the Electoral Code reflected “practices for the choice of a council which are generally acceptable to members of the Band, upon which there is a broad consensus” ( FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED ).

After reading the transcript of that meeting carefully, I have to say that the position taken by the Council of Elders on the question of the Electoral Code seems somewhat unclear. Reading the transcript, which was prepared in good faith and the content of which is not disputed in Court, leads me to conclude that nothing was decided by the elders at this meeting of December 22, 2005. It was instead a meeting at which participants discussed many matters, including the Electoral Code, but it appears to the Court that opinions varied and that no decision was taken on whether the Electoral Code applied. The only clear decision appears to have been to postpone the discussion to a new meeting of the Council of Elders after the holidays in early January 2006",
