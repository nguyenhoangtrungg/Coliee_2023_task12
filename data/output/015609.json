The panel noted that the applicant had not applied for refugee protection during her first visit to Canada in 2006, but had in fact filed such an application when she returned in November 2007.

In fact, the day of the hearing, the panel gave the applicant's counsel a copy of the advertising folder describing such development as a \"residential paradise, a cultural heartland and a land of endless opportunities\" and a \"secure idyllic community\".

First, I note that Rule 18 of the Rules requires a panel intending to use information to notify the claimant of refugee protection thereof, but does not specify any time frame for such notification. The rule reads as follows: 18. Before using any information or opinion that is within its specialized knowledge, the Division must notify the claimant or protected person, and the Minister if the Minister is present at the hearing, and give them a chance to ( a ) make representations on the reliability and use of the information or opinion; and ( b ) give evidence in support of their representations. 18. Avant d'utiliser un renseignement ou une opinion qui est du ressort de sa spécialisation, la Section en avise le demandeur d'asile ou la personne protégée et le ministre - si celui-ci est présent à l'audience - et leur donne la possibilité de: a ) faire des observations sur la fiabilité et l'utilisation du renseignement ou de l'opinion; b) fournir des éléments de preuve à l'appui de leurs observations",

      "content": "[17] It therefore does not appear essential for a party to be informed, prior to the hearing, that the panel will rely on information within its specialized knowledge. What is important is that a party can adequately assert his or her point of view on that information. That, moreover, is what my colleague Justice Gauthier concluded (when she was a member of this Court) in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED FTR 1: 57. In his first memorandum, the applicant referred to Rule 18 which, he says, applies in this case. This rule states that, before using any information or opinion that is within its specialized knowledge, the Division must notify claimants and give them a chance to make representations on the reliability and use of the information or opinion and to give evidence in support of their representations. According to the applicant, this unidentified, unsigned document in a package of immigration documents involving the applicant and his family does not meet the requirements of Rule 18. [58] It is certainly clear that the applicant cannot argue that the RPD did not inform him at the hearing about its concerns, which included those described above in the note at paragraph 54",

Following that consultation, neither counsel nor the applicant objected to the use of the folder. The applicant therefore cannot claim that she was not given an opportunity to make representations in respect of such folder, and her attempt to undermine the weight thereof before this Court by arguing that it is merely an advertising document embellishing reality comes very late",

      "content": "[20] The assessment of credibility falls within the expertise of the panel. It consequently requires application of the reasonableness standard ( FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED ( FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED )). More recently, the Supreme Court of Canada reconsidered the role of the courts in reviewing decisions. It took the opportunity to indicate that reviewing courts must show deference: 15. In assessing whether the decision is reasonable in light of the outcome and the reasons, courts must show \"respect for the decision-making process of adjudicative bodies with regard to both the facts and the law\" ( FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED , at para. 48). This means that courts should not substitute their own reasons, but they may, if they find it necessary, look to the record for the purpose of assessing the reasonableness of the outcome. [16] Reasons may not include all the arguments, statutory provisions, jurisprudence or other details the reviewing judge would have preferred, but that does not impugn the validity of either the reasons or the result under a reasonableness analysis. A decision-maker is not required to make an explicit finding on each constituent element, however subordinate, leading to its final conclusion ( Service Employees' International Union, Local No. 333 v. Nipawin District Staff Nurses Assn ., [1975] 1 S.C.R. 382, at p. 391). In other words, if the reasons allow the reviewing court to understand why the panel made its decision and permit it to determine whether the conclusion is within the range of acceptable outcomes, the FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED criteria are met.

      "content": "[24] It is erroneous to claim that the panel disregarded the discrimination and persecution suffered by the Ahmadis in Pakistan. The panel mentioned at the outset that the organization to which Imam Ali belongs is known for targeting and persecuting the Ahmadis, and admitted that the applicant may well have been targeted by the Imam (Reasons, at paragraphs 2 and 9). An attentive reading of the transcript reveals that the panel was familiar with the situation experienced by the Ahmadis in Pakistan",

      "content": "[25] It was, however, the applicant's responsibility to establish a link between the general situation of the Ahmadis and her personal fear, which she did not succeed in doing. In accordance with Rule 7 of the Rules , it is the applicant's responsibility to prove the allegations contained in her account. However, she did not discharge that burden. Not only was her account vague, but she did not produce any documentary evidence establishing that Imam Ali exists or that the incidents reported occurred",

    {
      "content": "[26] As this Court has mentioned, the panel can raise the absence of relevant documentary evidence if it finds contradictions or inconsistencies in an applicant's testimony ( FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED (available on CanLII)). Similarly, the presumption of truth attached to testimony under oath does not prevent the panel from assessing the applicant's credibility: It is true that an applicant's testimony must be presumed true unless there are valid reasons for rebutting that presumption ( FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED at page 305 (C.A.)). That being said, it was open to the panel to question the applicant to assess his credibility. The presumption of truthfulness does not exempt an applicant's evidence from the panel's assessment. In other words, an applicant will be given the benefit of the doubt only to the extent that the panel is satisfied with the applicant's credibility and has examined all of the evidence. In that respect , the Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status under the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees specifies the following: 203. . . . it is hardly possible for a refugee to \"prove\" every part of his case and, indeed, if this were a requirement the majority of refugees would not be recognized. It is therefore frequently necessary to give the applicant the benefit of the doubt. 204. The benefit of the doubt should, however, only be given when all available evidence has been obtained and checked and when the examiner is satisfied as to the applicant's general credibility. The applicant's statements must be coherent and plausible, and must not run counter to generally known facts",

Yet, the panel acknowledged that the applicant had not claimed asylum in Canada on the first opportunity that arose, that is in May 2006, and it agreed that the failure of a marriage can create animosity. It noted that the ex son-in-law's prediction nonetheless came true, and that a denunciation based on the intention to harm, as claimed by the applicant, does not necessarily mean that the denunciation was based on false information. Once again, the panel did not rely solely on such denunciation to rule out the presumption of truth, but concluded that it was one indication among others tending to show that the applicant had fabricated her story",

      "content": "[28] The applicant also claimed that the panel made errors in its assessment of the evidence. For example, the applicant maintains that the panel established an erroneous link between her social status and the impossibility that she could be a victim of persecution. She also claims that the panel made factual errors by assuming that all the members of her family should be subject to persecution, and that some members of her family still lived in the family home",

The panel wrote the following to that effect: 17. In addition the panel also finds it implausible that the claimant could not receive some form of police protection. The area that the claimant lived in is a very prosperous area and the security is provided by the military. The claimant's husband is a retired Major in the military and one of her sons is an active Major stationed in Rawalpindi",

It is true that the applicant could be more targeted because of her activities, but the panel was certainly at liberty to believe that all members of her family were vulnerable because of their Ahmadiyya faith and that it was therefore implausible that the applicant had to flee while some other members of the family still lived there. It is also true that in the amendment she provided to her PIF, she declared that no member of her family had lived in the residence in Lahore since she left.
