      "content": "[3] In Canada (Minister of Citizenship and FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED , the Federal Court of Appeal found the following: [19] It is common ground between counsel that refugee protection will be denied where it is shown that an applicant, at the time of the hearing, is entitled to acquire by mere formalities the citizenship (or nationality, both words being used interchangeably in this context) of a particular country with respect to which he has no well-founded fear of persecution. [20] This principle flows from a long line of jurisprudence starting with the decisions of our Court in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED (F.C.A.), where it was held that, if an applicant has citizenship in more than one country, he must demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution in relation to each country of citizenship before he can seek asylum in a country of which he is not a national. Our ruling in Ward was confirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada (at paragraph 12 of these reasons) and the principle eventually made its way into the IRPA, section 96 referring to \"each of their countries of nationality.\" [21] In another decision rendered before the Supreme Court of Canada rendered its own in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED , Rothstein J. (sitting then in the Trial Division of the Federal Court of Canada) broadened the holding of our Court in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED . He held that if, at the time of the hearing, an applicant is entitled to acquire the citizenship of a particular country by reason of his place of birth, and if that acquisition could be completed by mere formalities, thereby leaving no room for the State in question to refuse status, then the applicant is expected to seek the protection of that State and will be denied refugee status in Canada unless he has demonstrated that he also has a well-founded fear of persecution in relation to that additional country of nationality",

In the case at bar, the hearing lasted only 20 minutes. Is that sufficient reason to conclude that justice was denied. I am convinced it is not . As an administrative tribunal, the Refugee Board determines the subject matter and the scope of its hearings, provided it acts in good faith ( FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED ). Furthermore, MacKay J. pointed out in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED , that the Refugee Board controls its own process and the time allocated for each hearing. It goes without saying that the Board has the necessary discretion and expertise to estimate the time required for dealing with cases. On reading the record in this case, I found the facts to be relatively straightforward.

      "content": "[47] In FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED , above, the Federal Court of Appeal agreed with the reasons in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED A.C.W.S. (3d) 392: [22] I fully endorse the reasons for judgment of Rothstein J., and in particular the following passage, at page 77: The condition of not having a country of nationality must be one that is beyond the power of the applicant to control . The true test, in my view, is the following: if it is within the control of the applicant to acquire the citizenship of a country with respect to which he has no well-founded fear of persecution, the claim for refugee status will be denied. While words such as \"acquisition of citizenship in a non-discretionary manner\" or \"by mere formalities\" have been used, the test is better phrased in terms of \"power within the control of the applicant\" for it encompasses all sorts of situations, it prevents the introduction of a practice of \"country shopping\" which is incompatible with the \"surrogate\" dimension of international refugee protection recognized in Ward and it is not restricted, contrary to what counsel for the respondent has suggested, to mere technicalities such as filing appropriate documents. This \"control\" test also reflects the notion which is transparent in the definition of a refugee that the \"unwillingness\" of an applicant to take steps required from him to gain state protection is fatal to his refugee claim unless that unwillingness results from the very fear of persecution itself . Paragraph 106 of the Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status under the 1951 Convention an the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees emphasizes the point that whenever \"available, national protection takes precedence over international protection,\" and the Supreme Court of Canada, in Ward , observed, at p. 752, that \"[w]hen available, home state protection is a claimant's sole option.\" [23] The principle enunciated by Rothstein J. in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED was followed and applied ever since in Canada. Whether the citizenship of another country was obtained at birth, by naturalization or by State succession is of no consequence provided it is within the control of an applicant to obtain it.
