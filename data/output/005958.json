    {
      "content": "[1] Harrington, J. : Following the dismissal of his refugee claim, largely because he was found not to be credible and may not even have been in Sri Lanka at the relevant time, Mr. Velummayilum applied for a pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA). Such an application is limited to new evidence that arose after the rejection or was not reasonably available",
      "year": 2013

    {
      "content": "[2] Mr. Velummayilum submitted that country conditions in Sri Lanka had deteriorated since his refugee claim had been dismissed, and that he is facing new risks",

    {
      "content": "[3] He would be returning to Sri Lanka as a failed refugee and as someone who had left Sri Lanka with a forged identity card, an offence under that country's law",

      "content": "[4] The PRRA officer dismissed the application. The application for judicial review of that decision is hereby dismissed as well",

      "content": "[5] Although conditions in Sri Lanka are far from ideal, particularly for young male Tamils from the north and the east, it cannot be said, on the balance of probabilities, that the situation has deteriorated so that the PRRA officer's decision was unreasonable",

      "content": "[7] Any decision on a refugee claim is forward looking. The Refugee Protection Division, of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, has to decide whether there is a serious possibility of persecution on a United Nations ground under s. 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) or, under s. 97 on the balance of probabilities, a danger of torture or a risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment and punishment ( FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED , [2005] FCJ No 1 (QL))",

      "content": "[8] Mr. Velummayilum relies on the recent decision of FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [2013] FCJ No 612 (QL). Either that decision is distinguishable because it focused entirely on credibility issues, or it is inconsistent with the great deal of recent case law which has upheld the principle that it is no longer enough to fit the profile of a young male Tamil from the north or east Sri Lanka to be accorded refugee status. There must be something more.

However, Mr. Velummayilum has not been found to have any links with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, and so the risk of persecution, although always present, is no more than a mere possibility",

      "content": "[10] As to his forged identity card, if that serves as a basis for persecution, the persecution would be under s. 97 of IRPA, as it would not be based on the United Nations Convention ground.
