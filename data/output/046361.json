Justice Judith A. Snider's reasoning in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED , above, is instructive: [12] The Applicant submits that the Citizenship Judge erred by failing to make a specific determination of how many days the Applicant was actually physically present in Canada. In the absence of such a determination, the Applicant argues, the Judge cannot reasonably have concluded that the residency requirement of s. 5(1)(c) was not met. This argument, in my view, is fatally flawed. The burden is on the Applicant - not on the Citizenship Judge - to establish, with clear and compelling evidence, the number of days of residence. In this case, the Applicant failed to provide consistent and credible evidence with respect to his absences from Canada . [13] As recently stated by Justice Rennie in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED [2011] FCJ No 167: Irrespective of which test is applied, each applicant for citizenship bears the onus of establishing sufficient credible evidence on which an assessment of residency can be based , whether it is quantitative (Re Pourghasemi ) or qualitative ( Koo )",
