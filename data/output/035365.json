    {
      "content": "[2] It is accepted by the Respondent that the Applicant met all of the eligibility conditions for processing in that category, had the letter from his current employer been fully accepted by the officer. That letter confirmed the Applicant's title, salary, period of employment, projects worked on, and the duties he performed in this position",

      "content": "[4] The rejection of the application based on the credibility of the employer's letter is also confirmed in the officer's notes in the Global Case Management System: PA stated that she [ sic - it is \"he\"] has experience as a Construction Manager NOC 0711. PA submitted an employment letter from Dej Damghan Co. Main duties described in the employment letter for this position are either copied from the NOC description or closely paraphrased from the NOC for the occupation listed under NOC0711. This diminishes the overall credibility of the employment. The duties which were not copied from NOC do not satisfy me that PA indeed performed a significant amount of duties stated in NOC0711. Therefore, not satisfied that the ministerial instructions have been met in this occupation. RA5020: Pls draft eligibility-not met ltr and refund all processing fees",
