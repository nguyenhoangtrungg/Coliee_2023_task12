A panel of the Immigration and Refugee Board denied Mr. Wanchuk's claim on the basis that he could live safely in India, the country where he was born and, according to the Board, where he could obtain citizenship",

      "content": "[2] Mr. Wanchuk argues that the Board's decision was unreasonable given the evidence showing that it was not within his control to obtain citizenship in India - that was a discretionary decision left to Indian officials who are generally disinclined to grant citizenship to persons of Tibetan ancestry",

      "content": "[3] I agree with Mr. Wanchuk that the evidence shows he may have difficulty persuading Indian officials that he is eligible for Indian citizenship. His status depends on how discretion may be exercised by others; it is not within his control. Accordingly, the Board should have considered Mr. Wanchuk's claim as against China, not India",

Accordingly, the Minister argues that it was within Mr. Wanchuk's power to obtain citizenship in India and, therefore, the Board's decision was not unreasonable (citing Canada (Minister of Citizenship and FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED ). Further, even though Mr. Wanchuk would have to obtain a letter of \"no objection\" from the CTA prior to applying for Indian citizenship, the evidence showed that the CTA would not withhold its approval",

FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED • No grants of citizenship to Tibetans have been made in the three years following Dolkar . FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED • The official position of the CTA is that it will not withhold approval to Tibetans seeking Indian citizenship. However, in reality, the CTA is reluctant to grant approval, believing that Tibetans in India should remain refugees so as to ensure that they will eventually return to an independent Tibet",

It would require, at a minimum, that the CTA exercise its discretion not to withhold its approval and that Indian authorities recognize Dolkar as binding precedent. In fact, Mr. Wanchuk might well have to litigate the issue. I note that Ms. Dolkar expended several years in administrative and legal battles in order to obtain Indian citizenship",
