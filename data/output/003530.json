After having requested her money several times, the applicant allegedly went to her client's home, in September 2001, to again demand the amount owing to her, but her client purportedly threatened her and stated: [translation] \"If you talk to me like that, I'll send you someone to pay you\". That same evening, the applicant was attacked at home by two individuals, one of whom was her client's husband",

      "content": "[9] Although our jurisprudence has recognized women as a particular social group a number of times, the panel cannot agree that the claimant's fear of persecution is based on her gender in the present case.

    {
      "content": "[10] This conclusion on the part of the panel is based on all of the documentary evidence on record showing that criminal offences in Haiti do not exclusively affect women; men and children are actually just as likely as women to become victims of criminal gangs in Haiti. This means that, in Haiti, where crime assumes a number of forms, everyone living in the country, whether citizen or foreigner, is liable to be a potential victim. Regardless of the gender or origin of their victims, criminals steal, kidnap, kill and traffic in anything that might be lucrative. Their sole goal is to make money. [Reference omitted.] [7] The RPD found that the applicant's \"initial source of the fear\" is crime in Haiti and the fact that she had been attacked by criminals in the past and, consequently, [27] . . . as there is no evidence on record in this case showing that the claimant could be personally subjected to a risk to her life due to special circumstances other than the fact that she could be more easily identifiable as a member of the diaspora, [the RPD] concludes that the risk alleged by the claimant that she might fall victim to crime is a random risk faced indiscriminately by everybody living in the country. This risk affecting the claimant is not a personal or particular risk, and it is not solely limited to people who, as is the claimant's case, return to live in Haiti after spending time abroad. This case is therefore covered by the exception stipulated in subparagraph 97(1)( b )(ii) of the IRPA. The claimant is not a person in need of protection. IV. Issue [8] In the case at bar, the Court is called upon to respond only to the following question: Did the RPD commit an unreasonable error in finding that the applicant was not a \"person in need of protection\" under the IRPA. V. Analysis A. Standard of review [9] The issue addresses the interpretation of the IRPA and its application to the facts. This is therefore a question of mixed fact and law; the standard of review that applies is thus reasonableness ( FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED ). Considerable deference is required. B . Social group as defined in the Convention [10] In her memorandum, the applicant maintains that in Haiti [translation] \"the situation of criminal insecurity, which is said to be at the root of the rape [that she] experienced . . . , does not eliminate . . . the rape in itself as a fear of persecution\". Furthermore, she maintains [translation] \"that this uncontradicted evidence was improperly assessed\", since the RPD [translation] \"should have considered . . . that the applicant was part of the social group of raped ",

      "content": "[11] According to the applicant, the fact that the RPD connected her fear to the situation of general crime prevalent in Haiti constitutes an error that warrants the intervention of this Court. However, since the applicant herself alleged, in support of her refugee claim, that she fears crime and the people who allegedly attacked her so that she would not demand the amount owed to her, this is an approach that the RPD could legitimately take, even if it is unfavourable for the applicant. It is the RPD's responsibility to determine whether the applicant's claim for protection is in any way connected to the definition of Convention refugee; it is not the Court's role to make such a determination, as the applicant is asking it to do",
