      "content": "[2] The applicant is a Chinese Christian who attended a house church in China. Before the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (the Board) he claimed that while on business in Vancouver in January 2007, his family informed him that he was wanted by the Public Service Bureau (PSB) in China for participation in illegal religious activities. On that basis he made a claim for refugee protection on February 13, 2007",

      "content": "[3] The applicant's refugee claim was rejected on March 3, 2009. The Board did not believe that he was a citizen of the People's Republic of China. As a result of this conclusion the Board did not consider the merits of his claim. The applicant's application for leave for judicial review to the Federal Court was dismissed on July 24, 2009",

Specifically, the Officer concluded that the applicant had not put forth \"objective documentary evidence to support that his profile in China is similar to those that currently face a danger of torture, or a risk to life, or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in that country.\" The PRRA Officer further concluded that \"the evidence before [him] does not support that the Chinese authorities are aware [that the applicant is a practicing Christian] \"",

Did the PRRA Officer fail to give reasons for his finding that there was no evidence that the Chinese were aware of the applicant or had an interest in him. b. Did the PRRA Officer fail to differentiate between the practice of religion within and outside of registered churches as well as fail to consider evidence of the limitations placed on the practice of religion in China either within or outside of the state sanctioned churches",

This was her stated reason for not wishing to attend a state-sanctioned church. That church fails to follow one of her principal beliefs. This is the conviction that should have been analyzed by the Board; it is entirely irrelevant whether state-sanctioned churches embrace conventional Protestant teachings",

      "content": "[14] All of the evidence upon which the Officer relied, some of which spoke of increasing religious tolerance, was in respect of state sanctioned churches. This case is, thus both on its facts and in respect of the error which warrants the decision being set aside, similar to that in FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED wherein Justice James Russell addressed the failure of the Board to consider the distinction between state sanctioned churches and unregistered churches: The RPD's findings in this regard are unreasonable and rife with error. There was ample evidence before the RPD that religion is not practised freely within registered churches, and that the members of unregistered churches may be persecuted. Indeed, there was specific evidence before the RPD with regard to the differences between the religious practices in registered churches versus those in unregistered churches, which could entice believers to turn to unregistered churches in order to freely practise their faith",
