The RPD found that, on the whole, the applicants were credible, had properly established the facts and had testified in a detailed manner. However, it noted a few omissions and inconsistencies. The RPD therefore concluded that the applicants had not demonstrated a subjective fear of persecution and that they had not acted like individuals with a fear of persecution or a fear for their lives if they were to return to Colombia",

First, the applicants remained in Bogota and moved only 3 kilometres from their former residence following the threats they had received. Second, the principal applicant waited until 2011 before filing his written denunciations, over four years after his dismissal. Third, the principal applicant failed to establish a link between his mother's assault and the threats he had allegedly received. Fourth, the principal applicant had not demonstrated that Mr. Garcia had influenced the legal proceedings against him. Fifth, the applicants did not claim refugee protection at the first opportunity, either when the principal applicant was in the United States or when the applicants were reunited in Panama.

First, the fact that the applicants had waited four years before leaving Colombia and had moved only 3 kilometres from their former residence, while remaining in Bogota, shows that they did not have a subjective fear. Second, Mr. Garcia was forced to resign from his position at INCO in 2009. Had he wished to cause the applicants harm, he had ample time in which to do so prior to their leaving Colombia, but did not do so. Third, the RAD did not find it credible that Mr. Garcia could influence the criminal investigation of the principal applicant, further concluding that if Mr. Garcia had such influence, he would not have been forced to resign from his position. Fourth, the RAD found that although there are many challenges for Colombia to overcome, the Colombian legal system was not manipulated in a manner that resulted in the persecution of the principal applicant; and, at any rate, the applicants had not met their burden of establishing that the legal proceedings had been influenced by Mr. Garcia. Lastly, the RAD found that the applicants had failed to rebut the presumption of state protection",

A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion, ( a ) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or ( b ) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country. Person in need of protection 97 . (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally ( a ) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or ( b ) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if (i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country, (ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country, (iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and (iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care. (2) A person in Canada who is a member of a class of persons prescribed by the regulations as being in need of protection is also a person in need of protection. Définition de « réfugié » 96 . A qualité de réfugié au sens de la Convention - le réfugié - la personne qui, craignant avec raison d'être persécutée du fait de sa race, de sa religion, de sa nationalité, de son appartenance à un groupe social ou de ses opinions politiques: a ) soit se trouve hors de tout pays dont elle a la nationalité et ne peut ou, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut se réclamer de la protection de chacun de ces pays; b ) soit, si elle n'a pas de nationalité et se trouve hors du pays dans lequel elle avait sa résidence habituelle, ne peut ni, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut y retourner.

First, it was reasonable for the RAD to conclude that the applicants had no subjective fear of persecution. As far as credibility is concerned, the respondent points out that RPD had not found all of the evidence and facts presented to be credible. The RPD did not find it credible that Mr. Garcia would have had an influence on the legal proceedings against the principal applicant. Furthermore, the RAD concluded that there was an absence of subjective fear when it considered the applicants' conduct in Colombia between 2007 and 2013, in addition to the fact that the applicants waited a lengthy six years before claiming refugee status in another country. Second, the respondent maintains that it is not persecution that the principal applicant fears, but rather judicial prosecution following criminal charges. Third, the applicants' argument regarding the cumulative effect must be dismissed because it is a new argument that had not been raised before the RAD. Lastly, the respondent submits that the RAD reasonably confirmed the decision of the RPD with respect to state protection. As a result, the respondent did not put forth an argument in that regard. For these reasons, in the respondent's opinion, the RAD's decision was reasonable",

In its decision, the RPD raised several elements in respect of which they determined that the applicants were not credible, and which resulted in the RPD concluding that the applicants had not demonstrated a subjective fear: • They moved only 3 kilometres from their former residence while going about their normal lives as before; • The principal applicant was vague and hesitant as to why he waited four years before making his denunciations; • He had failed to establish a link between his parents' assault and his denunciations; • Although he claimed to fear Mr. Gomez, the principal applicant only talked about Mr. Gomez when the RPD questioned him on the subject.
