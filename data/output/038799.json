The Adjudicator revoked the availability of passport services to the Applicant for a period of five years, starting on December 23, 2010",

      "content": "[2] The parties do not dispute that on December 23, 2010, an unknown individual [the Impostor] attempted to board a flight from Istanbul, Turkey, to Toronto, using the Applicant's passport [the Passport]. The Impostor was removed from the flight by the authorities but was not detained for any length of time. His identity is unknown. The parties also do not dispute that Ali Reza Gomravi was also on that flight, and that Mr. Gomravi is an old friend of the Applicant's. In fact, Mr. Gomravi was used as a reference for the Applicant's May 6, 2006 Passport application",

He was to return to Toronto from Bonn, Germany via Istanbul on December 22, 2010 in the company of Mr. Gomravi. After sleeping in the Istanbul airport overnight, the Applicant realized his Passport and boarding pass were missing. He immediately reported this to the Turkish authorities, who detained him until January 3, 2011, when he paid a bribe to secure his release. Upon his release, the authorities provided the Applicant his Passport. He then flew from Istanbul to Dubai, United Arab Emirates on January 8, 2011. After three days in the airport in Dubai, he flew to Vienna, Austria via Damman, Saudi Arabia on January 11, 2011, before eventually flying to Toronto via Paris. The Applicant claims not to know the Impostor",

      "content": "[5] The Respondent alleges that the Impostor and the Applicant knew each other, and that Mr. Gomravi acted as a facilitator for the Impostor to come to Canada illegally. The Respondent does not believe that the Applicant was in Istanbul on December 22, 2010, a fact corroborated by Mr. Gomravi. The Passport appears to have been returned to the Impostor after he was removed from the plane",

This letter gave the Applicant an opportunity to respond to the investigation against him by providing additional information prior to the issuance of a final decision by the Adjudicator. Subsequent to this proposal letter and prior to the Adjudicator's decision, 36 emails were exchanged between various officials at Passport Canada and the Applicant",

      "content": "[9] The Adjudicator's decision hinged on the improbability of the Applicant's explanation as to why the Impostor was using his Passport on December 23, 2010. The Adjudicator describes two alternate scenarios that would have had to occur if the Applicant's version of events is believed: A. The Impostor found the Applicant's Passport and boarding pass and attempted to use them. Upon failing, the Imposter disposed of the Passport, where it was subsequently found by the authorities some time later; or B. Airport security found the Passport and the Applicant's boarding pass and acted as accomplices to the Impostor before subsequently disembarking him, re-acquiring the Passport, and later forcing the Applicant to pay a bribe to obtain his passport",

      "content": "[11] Based on these probabilities and a lack of evidence supporting a contrary explanation, other than from the Applicant himself, the Adjudicator determined that the Applicant allowed the Impostor to use his Passport to travel to Toronto and Mr. Gomravi acted as a facilitator. The Passport was then returned to him for his flight from Vienna on January 12, 2010. This constituted a breach of section 10(2)(c) of the Order",

(1) Without limiting the generality of subsections 4(3) and (4) and for the greater certainty, the Minister may revoke a passport on the same grounds on which he or she may refuse to issue a passport. (2) In addition, the Minister may revoke the passport of a person who (c) permits another person to use the passport; 10.3 If a passport that is issued to a person has expired but could have been revoked under any of the grounds set out in sections 10 and 10.1 had it not expired, the Minister may impose a period of refusal of passport services on those same grounds, except for the grounds set out in paragraph 9(g), if the facts that could otherwise have led to the revocation of the passport occurred before its expiry date.

The lack of any evidence from the Applicant's friend, Mr. Gomravi, to corroborate the Applicant's story about his presence in Istanbul, or that he was not a facilitator to the Imposter in using Mr. Latifi's passport, as well as the lack of any objective evidence concerning Mr. Latifi's detention, led to the investigator's decision to revoke the Applicant's passport for a period of five years",

The Adjudicator based his decision in the low probability that the Applicant's version of events occurred and the lack of objective evidence to support it.
